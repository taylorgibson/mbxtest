  "body": " This text began as my sabbatical project in the winter semester of 2012, during which I wrote most of the material for the first four chapters. For the sabbatical leave, I am indebted to Grand Valley State University for its support of the project, as well as to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for their endorsement of the project. I'm also grateful to the American Institute of Mathematics for their support of free and open textbooks in general , and their support of this one in particular.  The beautiful full-color .eps graphics in the text are only possible because of David Austin of GVSU and Bill Casselman of the University of British Columbia. Building on their longstanding efforts to develop tools for high quality mathematical graphics, David wrote a library of Python routines that employ Bill's PiScript program ; David's routines are so easy to use that even I could generate graphics like the professionals that he and Bill are. I am deeply grateful to them both.  The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original Mathbook XML, now known as PreTeXt . My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due in large part to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016, as well as the support of the ongoing user group . A subsequent workshop in June 2019 has offered further support and more improvements to the text.  David Farmer's conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original latex source and converting it to PreTeXt ; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy. Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help, and it is through Alex's fantastic work that live WeBWorK exercises are not only possible, but also included from the 2017 version forward. Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book's production editor; his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book, including the presence of answers to activities and non- WeBWorK exercises and other supporting material for instructors.  For the 2018 edition, Kathy Yoshiwara of the AIM Editorial Board read the entire text and contributed editorial suggestions for every section. In short, she made the prose cleaner, more direct, and simply better. I'm deeply thankful for her time, effort, and insights.  Over my more than 20 years at GVSU, many of my colleagues have shared with me ideas and resources for teaching calculus. I am particularly indebted to David Austin, Will Dickinson, Paul Fishback, Jon Hodge, and Steve Schlicker for their contributions that improved my teaching of and thinking about calculus, including materials that I have modified and used over many different semesters with students. Parts of these ideas can be found throughout this text. In addition, Will Dickinson and Steve Schlicker provided me access to a large number of their electronic notes and activities from teaching of differential and integral calculus, and those ideas and materials have similarly impacted my work and writing in positive ways, with some of their problems and approaches finding parallel presentation here.  In the summer of 2012, David and Steve each agreed to write a chapter to support the completion of the material on integral calculus. David is the lead author of Chapter and Steve the lead author of Chapter . Along with our colleague Ted Sundstrom, Steve has also contributed a large number of problem and activity solutions and answers. I'm especially grateful for how the work of these friends and colleagues has made the text so much better.  Shelly Smith of GVSU and Matt DeLong of Marian University both provided extensive comments on the first few chapters of early drafts, feedback that was immensely helpful in improving the text. As more and more people use the text, I am grateful to everyone who reads, edits, and uses this book, and hence contributes to its improvement through ongoing discussion.  Finally, I am grateful for all that my students have taught me over the years. Their responses and feedback have helped to shape me as a teacher, and I appreciate their willingness to wholeheartedly engage in the activities and approaches I've tried in class, to let me know how those affect their learning, and to help me learn and grow as an instructor. Early on, they also provided useful editorial feedback on this text.  Any and all remaining errors or inconsistencies are mine. I will gladly take reader and user feedback to correct them, along with other suggestions to improve the text.   "

  "title": "Active Calculus: Our Goals",
  "body": " Active Calculus: Our Goals  Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.  While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance. In the 21st century and the age of the internet, no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is free . See https:\/\/activecalculus.org for links to both the .html and .pdf versions of the text. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source . See GitHub for the source. Since August 2013, Active Calculus - Single Variable has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its Open Textbook Initiative .  In Active Calculus - Single Variable , we actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are generated by students. Where many texts present a general theory followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand calculus for themselves. This approach is consistent with the scholarly consensus that calls for students to be interactively engaged in class.  Moreover, this approach is consistent with the following goals:   To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners construct solutions and approaches to ideas, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.    To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true. Often we do this through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.    To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, working on activities in small groups in class, and doing substantial exercises outside of class time.    To strengthen students' written and oral communicating skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of calculus.     "

  "title": "Features of the Text",
  "body": " Features of the Text  Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:   Motivating Questions  At the start of each section, we list 2 3 motivating questions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One overall goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.    Preview Activities  Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a preview activity . This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and to be completed by students before the day on which a particular section is to be considered.    Activities  A typical section in the text has at least three activities . These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working individually or in small groups.    Exercises  There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the Open Problem Library and around 20,000 calculus problems. In this text, each section includes a small number of anonymous WeBWorK exercises, as well as 3 4 challenging problems per section. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .html version of the text , as this provides students with immediate feedback without penalty. Almost every non- WeBWorK exercise has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Calculus text by Greg Hartmann et al., available from www.apexcalculus.com .    Graphics  We strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color To keep cost low, the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.    Links to interactive graphics  Many of the ideas of calculus are best understood dynamically; java applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations. Relying primarily on the work of David Austin of Grand Valley State University and Marc Renault of Shippensburg University, each of whom has developed a large library of applets for calculus, we frequently point the reader (through active links in the electronic versions of the text) to applets that are relevant for key ideas under consideration.    Summary of Key Ideas  Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

  "body": " Students! Read this!  This book is different.  The text is available in three different formats: HTML, PDF, and print, each of which is available via links on the landing page at activecalculus.org\/ . The first two formats are free. If you are going to use the book electronically, the best mode is the HTML . The HTML version looks great in any browser, including on a smartphone, and the links are much easier to navigate in HTML than in PDF. Some particular direct suggestions about using the HTML follow among the next few paragraphs; alternatively, you can watch this short video from the author . It is also wise to download and save the PDF, since you can use the PDF offline, while the HTML version requires an internet connection. A print copy costs about $21 via Amazon .  This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference. For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class. Your instructor may require you to do this. Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections. There are not answers provided to Preview Activities, as these are designed simply to get you thinking about ideas that will be helpful in work on upcoming new material.  As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book. There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others. Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding. You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor. You can purchase a separate Activities Workbook from Amazon ( Chapters 1-4 , Chapters 5-8 ) in which to record your work on the activities, or you can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work. Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work. You can find answers to the activities in the back matter .  Each section concludes with a Summary. Reading the Summary after you have read the section and worked the Activities is a good way to find a short list of key ideas that are most essential to take from the section. A good study habit is to write similar summaries in your own words.  At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises. First, there are several anonymous WeBWorK exercises. These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see this short video on the HTML version that includes a WeBWorK demonstration). You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section. If your institution uses WeBWorK , you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned WeBWorK sets as part of your course grade. The WeBWorK exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account. Following the WeBWorK exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding. There are answers to most of the non- WeBWorK exercises in the back matter .  You can find additional support for your work in learning calculus from the GVSU Math 201 YouTube Channel and GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel where there are several short video tutorials for each section of the text, numbered in alignment with the textbook sections. Math 201 corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 to Chapters 5-8; there are about 90 videos for each, totaling more than 180.  The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas. We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding. This text has been designed to help you make sense of calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.  "

  "title": "Instructors!  Read this!",
  "body": " Instructors! Read this!  This book is different. Before you read further, first read Students! Read this! .  Chapters 1-4 are designed to correspond to what is often called differential calculus. Chapters 5-8 correspond roughly to what is often called integral calculus, including chapters on differential equations and infinite series.  Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector. The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious. We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access. It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which is available on Amazon ( Chapters 1-4 , Chapters 5-8 ) or as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.  The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time. A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:   Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class. Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion. (5-10 minutes)    Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes)     Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes)     Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas. (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)    Possibly begin next activity.   The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities. Then rinse and repeat.  We recommend that instructors use appropriate incentives to encourage students to complete Preview Activities prior to class. Having these be part of completion-based assignments that count 5% of the semester grade usually results in the vast majority of students completing the vast majority of the previews. If you'd like to see a sample syllabus for how to organize a course and weight various assignments, you can request one via email to the author.  Note that the WeBWorK exercises in the HTML version are anonymous and there's not a way to track students' engagement with them. These are intended to be formative for students and provide them with immediate feedback without penalty. If your institution is a WeBWorK user, we have existing sets of .def files that correspond to the sections in the text; these are available upon request to the author.  In the back matter of the text, you'll find answers to the Activities and to non- WeBWorK Exercises . Instructors interested in solutions to these should contact the author directly.  You and your students can find additional resources in the GVSU Math 201 YouTube Channel and GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel where there are short video tutorials for every section of the text. Math 201 (GVSU's Calculus I) corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 (GVSU's Calculus II) to Chapters 5-8.  The PreTeXt source code for the text can be found on GitHub . If you find errors in the text or have other suggestions, you can file an issue on GitHub, use the Feedback link in the HTML version (found at the bottom left in the main menu), or email the author directly. To engage with instructors who use the text, we maintain both an email list and the Open Calculus blog ; you can request that your address be added to the email list by contacting the author. Finally, if you're interested in a video presentation on using the text, you can see this online video presentation to the MIT Electronic Seminar on Mathematics Education ; at about the 17-minute mark, the portion begins where we demonstrate features of and how to use the text.  Thank you for considering Active Calculus as a resource to help your students develop deep understanding of the subject. I wish you the very best in your work and hope to hear from you.  "

  "title": "How do we measure velocity?",
  "body": " How do we measure velocity?     How is the average velocity of a moving object connected to the values of its position function?    How do we interpret the average velocity of an object geometrically on the graph of its position function?    How is the notion of instantaneous velocity connected to average velocity?      Calculus can be viewed broadly as the study of change. A natural and important question to ask about any changing quantity is how fast is the quantity changing?   We begin with a simple problem: a ball is tossed straight up in the air. How is the ball moving? Questions like this one are central to our study of differential calculus.    Suppose that the height of a ball at time (in seconds) is given in feet by the formula .   Construct a graph of on the time interval . Label at least six distinct points on the graph, including the three points showing when the ball was released, when the ball reaches its highest point, and when the ball lands.    Describe the behavior of the ball on the time interval and on time interval . What occurs at the instant ?    Consider the expression . Compute the value of . What does this value measure on the graph? What does this value tell us about the motion of the ball? In particular, what are the units on ?         Position and average velocity  Any moving object has a position  position that can be considered a function of time . When the motion is along a straight line, the position is given by a single variable, which we denote by . For example, might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time in hours. Similarly, the function described in Preview Activity is a position function, where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.  On any time interval, a moving object also has an average velocity . For example, to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed, which gives the velocity in miles per hour . Similarly, the value of in Preview Activity gave the average velocity of the ball on the time interval , measured in feet per second.  In general, we make the following definition:   Average Velocity  For an object moving in a straight line with position function , the average velocity  average velocity of the object on the interval from to , denoted , is given by the formula .   Note well: the units on are units of per unit of , such as miles per hour or feet per second.     The following questions concern the position function given by , considered in Preview Activity .     Compute the average velocity of the ball on each of the following time intervals: , , , , , , , . Include units for each value.    On the graph provided in Figure , sketch the line that passes through the points and . What is the meaning of the slope of this line? In light of this meaning, what is a geometric way to interpret each of the values computed in the preceding question?    Use a graphing utility to plot the graph of on an interval containing the value . Then, zoom in repeatedly on the point . What do you observe about how the graph appears as you view it more and more closely?    What do you conjecture is the velocity of the ball at the instant ? Why?      A partial plot of .         On , the average velocity is ft\/sec.    Remember that the slope of a line can be found by taking rise over run. In this context, the slope is found by computing change in over change in .     While the curve is a parabola, how does it look up close on a very small interval?     Instantaneous velocity can be approximated by average velocity on a very small interval.           ft\/sec; ft\/sec; the other average velocities are, respectively, 6.56, 6.416, 0, 4.8, 6.24, 6.384, all in ft\/sec.     is the average velocity of the ball between and .       Like a straight line with slope about 6.4.    About 6.4 feet per second.          On , the average velocity is ft\/sec. On , the average velocity is 8 ft\/sec. The other average velocities are, respectively (in the order of the intervals listed in the activity), 6.56, 6.416, 0, 4.8, 6.24, 6.384, all measured in feet per second.    The slope of the line between and is . This is precisely the average velocity of the ball between and , and indeed each of the average velocities computed in (a) can be viewed as the slope of the line joining the points and .       As we zoom in on the curve at the point , the graph begins to look like a straight line. Indeed, it appears to look like a straight line with slope about 6.4.    Observe that the average velocity of the ball on the intervals and is 6.416 and 6.384 feet\/sec respectively. Hence it appears that the ball's velocity at the instant should be about 6.4 feet per second.         Instantaneous Velocity  Whether we are driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball, we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment -- a number that measures how fast the object is moving right now . For instance, a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant. In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval. If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter, we can progress from average velocity to instantaneous velocity.  Informally, we define the instantaneous velocity  instantaneous velocity of a moving object at time to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing . We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon, and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus. For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows: take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point. If those average velocities approach a single number, then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.    Each of the following questions concern , the position function from Preview Activity .     Compute the average velocity of the ball on the time interval . What is different between this value and the average velocity on the interval ?    Use appropriate computing technology to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Likewise, estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Which value is greater?    How is the sign of the instantaneous velocity of the ball related to its behavior at a given point in time? That is, what does positive instantaneous velocity tell you the ball is doing? Negative instantaneous velocity?    Without doing any computations, what do you expect to be the instantaneous velocity of the ball at ? Why?          Remember to use the formula for average velocity from above: . Think carefully about whether certain quantities are positive or negative.    To estimate the instantaneous velocity at , consider average velocities on the intervals and .    Think about whether the ball is rising or falling.    What is the average velocity of the ball on small intervals that contain ?           ft\/sec, which is negative.    The instantaneous velocity at is approximately ft\/sec; at , the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec, and .    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    Zero.           ft\/sec. We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft\/sec on the interval .    Since and , it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at is approximately ft\/sec. Similar computations show that at , it appears the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec. Note that , so the instantaneous velocity at is greater because it is less negative. Asking which number is greater is different from asking which number is more negative.     When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    Note that is the vertex of the parabola given by . At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling. On intervals of the form , where , the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form , where , the average velocity is positive. Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment to be zero.        At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity. Each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function. We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval for smaller and smaller intervals. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, think of the value as , where is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary. Then the average velocity of the object on the interval is , with the denominator being simply because . Note that when , measures the average velocity on the interval .  To find the instantaneous velocity at , we investigate what happens as the value of approaches zero.   Computing instantaneous velocity for a falling ball   The position function for a falling ball is given by (where is measured in feet and in seconds).    Find an expression for the average velocity of the ball on a time interval of the form where and .  Use this expression to compute the average velocity on and .  Make a conjecture about the instantaneous velocity at .        We make the assumptions that and because cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval , as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. We want to compute and simplify . We start by finding . To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function . . Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that . At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on , which it must, since as changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since can never equal zero, we may remove the common factor of from the numerator and denominator. It follows that .  From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of . For instance, to obtain the average velocity on , we let , and the average velocity is ft\/sec. To get the average velocity on , we let , and compute the average velocity as .  We can even explore what happens to as gets closer and closer to zero. As approaches zero, will also approach zero, so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at should be ft\/sec.        For the function given by from Preview Activity , find the most simplified expression you can for the average velocity of the ball on the interval .

The graph of position function together with the line through and whose slope is . The line's slope is the average rate of change of on the interval .     Given a moving object whose position at time is given by a function , the average velocity of the object on the time interval is given by . Viewing the interval as having the form , we equivalently compute average velocity by the formula .  The instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time is estimated by considering average velocities on shorter and shorter time intervals that contain the instant of interest.

The average velocity over the interval is given by ft\/s. A reasonable estimate for the velocity at is the average ft\/s.      Rate of calorie consumption   The table below shows the number of calories used per minute as a function of an individual's body weight for three sports:    Activity  100 lb  120 lb  150 lb  170 lb  200 lb  220 lb    Walking  2.7  3.2  4  4.6  5.4  5.9    Bicycling  5.4  6.5  8.1  9.2  10.8  11.9    Swimming  5.8  6.9  8.7  9.8  11.6  12.7    a) Determine the number of calories that a 200 lb person uses in one half-hour of walking . calories  b) Who uses more calories, a 170 lb person swimming for one hour, or a 220 lb person bicycling for a half-hour?   The 170 lb person swimming for one hour    The 220 lb person bicycling for a half-hour    They both use the same amount of calories    c) Does the number of calories of a person walking increase or decrease as weight increases?   Increase    Decrease          SOLUTION a) The table gives the amount of calories used per minute. So in order to find the total number of calories used in a half-hour, use the table to find the number of calories used by a 200 lb who walks for a half-hour, and then multiply by 30 minutes. Using the table we know a 200 lb person walking uses 5.4 calories per minute; therefore, b) Using the same calculation as in (a), it follows that a 170 lb person swimming uses 9.8 calories per minute. Thus a 170 lb person swimming for one hour uses a total of calories. On the other hand, a 220 lb person bicycling uses 11.9 calories per minute. Thus a 220 lb person bicycling for a half-hour uses a total of calories. By comparing the values 588 and 357 we obtain the answer. c) Since the values in the table are increasing along the row of values corresponding to a person who is walking, the number of calories of a person walking increases as weight increases.

Type the corresponding letter of the line segment next to the appropriate formula. Clearly not all letters will be used.

Thus line segment D connecting the points (0, 9 ) and ( 1, 8 ) illustrates formula (i), line segment C connecting the points ( 1, 8 ) and ( 3, 0 ) illustrates formula (ii), and line segment B connecting the points (0, 9 ) and ( 3, 0 ) illustrates formula (iii).      Comparing average rate of change of two functions   Consider the graphs of and below:   For each interval given below, decide whether the average rate of change of or is greater over that particular interval.    Interval  Which function has GREATER average rate of change?      f  g  both have an equal rate of change       f  g  both have an equal rate of change       f  g  both have an equal rate of change       f  g  both have an equal rate of change       f  g  both have an equal rate of change                               SOLUTION Since the graph of is a line, its average rate of change is the same over all intervals. Since the graph of is going up, its average rate of change is always positive. The average rate of change of is clearly changing depending on the interval. If the slope of the line connecting the two endpoints of the interval on is going up and is steeper than the slope of , then the average rate of change of will be greater over that interval. If the line connecting the two endpoints points on is less steep, horizontal, or going down, then the average rate of change of will greater over that interval. If the slope of the line connecting to endpoints of the interval on is the same as the slope of , then the two average rates of change will be equal (such as the case for the interval . Based on this consideration, you should determine the following answers:   Interval  Which function has GREATER average rate of change?     g     g     f     f     g         Matching a distance graph to velocity   A car is driven at an increasing speed, starting at noon. Which of the following could be a graph of the distance the car has traveled as a function of time past noon?    1.   2.   3.   4.     5.   6.   7.   8.     figure .        SOLUTION  Because the car is driven at an increasing speed, the distance traveled for different time intervals of the same length must increase as time goes on. Therefore the slope of the graph of distance traveled must increase with increasing time, and must be 4.        A bungee jumper dives from a tower at time . Her height (measured in feet) at time (in seconds) is given by the graph in Figure . In this problem, you may base your answers on estimates from the graph or use the fact that the jumper's height function is given by .   A bungee jumper's height function.       What is the change in vertical position of the bungee jumper between and ?    Estimate the jumper's average velocity on each of the following time intervals: , , , and . Include units on your answers.    On what time interval(s) do you think the bungee jumper achieves her greatest average velocity? Why?    Estimate the jumper's instantaneous velocity at . Show your work and explain your reasoning, and include units on your answer.    Among the average and instantaneous velocities you computed in earlier questions, which are positive and which are negative? What does negative velocity indicate?          .         Most negative average velocity on ; most positive average velocity on .     feet per second.    The average velocities are negative; the instantaneous velocity was positive. Downward motion corresponds to negative average velocity; upward motion to positive average velocity.         Since and , the bungee jumper's change in vertical position between  is .    We estimate the jumper's average velocity using the formula . Using the approximations from part (a) and , we have The units on each of these average velocities are ``feet per second''.    On the time interval the jumper has the greatest change in position over that period of time, so it is on that interval that her average velocity is greatest in magnitude (but negative in sign). For the same reasons, the largest (positive) average velocity will occur on the interval .    We can approximate the jumper's average velocity on the intervals and and find the average of these average velocities. This will give us the slope of the secant line connecting the points and and be a reasonably good approximation to the instantaneous velocity at . Now so the jumper's instantaneous velocity at is about feet per second.    The average velocities we calculated were all negative, while the instantaneous velocity was positive. When the jumper is moving in the downward direction, the average velocity will be negative (indicating a decrease in position), while a positive average velocity indicates an increase in position (moving upwards).       A diver leaps from a 3 meter springboard. His feet leave the board at time , he reaches his maximum height of 4.5 m at seconds, and enters the water at . Once in the water, the diver coasts to the bottom of the pool (depth 3.5 m), touches bottom at , rests for one second, and then pushes off the bottom. From there he coasts to the surface, and takes his first breath at .     Let denote the function that gives the height of the diver's feet (in meters) above the water at time . (Note that the height of the bottom of the pool is meters.) Sketch a carefully labeled graph of on the provided axes in Figure . Include scale and units on the vertical axis. Be as detailed as possible.    Axes for plotting in part (a).     Axes for plotting in part (c).       Based on your graph in (a), what is the average velocity of the diver between and ? Is his average velocity the same on every time interval within ?    Let the function represent the instantaneous vertical velocity of the diver at time (i.e. the speed at which the height function is changing; note that velocity in the upward direction is positive, while the velocity of a falling object is negative). Based on your understanding of the diver's behavior, as well as your graph of the position function, sketch a carefully labeled graph of on the axes provided in Figure . Include scale and units on the vertical axis. Write several sentences that explain how you constructed your graph, discussing when you expect to be zero, positive, negative, relatively large, and relatively small.    Is there a connection between the two graphs that you can describe? What can you say about the velocity graph when the height function is increasing? decreasing? Make as many observations as you can.         Sketch a plot where the diver's height at time is on the vertical axis. For instance, .      m\/sec. The average velocity is not the same on every time interval within .    When the diver is going upward, her velocity is positive. When she is going downward, her velocity is negative. At the peak of her dive and when her feet touch the bottom of the pool.     It looks like when the position function is steep, the velocity function's value is farther away from zero, and that whenever the height\/position function is rising\/increasing, the velocity function has a positive value. Similarly, whenever the position function is decreasing, the velocity is negative.         Taking into account the given information and our intuition about the diver's velocity, ketch a plot where the diver's height at time is on the vertical axis. For instance, .     First, we see that m\/sec. The average velocity is not the same on every time interval within , since the position function is not linear. Physically, we expect the water to make the diver's velocity change as she glides through the water.    When the diver is going upward, her velocity is positive. When she is going downward, her velocity is negative. At the peak of her dive and when her feet touch the bottom of the pool, her velocity is zero because the velocity is changing sign there. Sketch a possible graph accordingly.     It looks like when the position function is steep, the velocity function's value is farther away from zero, and that whenever the height\/position function is rising\/increasing, the velocity function has a positive value. Similarly, whenever the position function is decreasing, the velocity is negative.       According to the U.S. census, the population of the city of Grand Rapids, MI, was 181,843 in 1980; 189,126 in 1990; and 197,800 in 2000.    Between 1980 and 2000, by how many people did the population of Grand Rapids grow?  In an average year between 1980 and 2000, by how many people did the population of Grand Rapids grow?  Just like we can find the average velocity of a moving body by computing change in position over change in time, we can compute the average rate of change of any function . In particular, the average rate of change of a function over an interval is the quotient . What does the quantity measure on the graph of over the interval ?  Let represent the population of Grand Rapids at time , where is measured in years from January 1, 1980. What is the average rate of change of on the interval to ? What are the units on this quantity?  If we assume the population of Grand Rapids is growing at a rate of approximately 4% per decade, we can model the population function with the formula . Use this formula to compute the average rate of change of the population on the intervals , , , , and .  How fast do you think the population of Grand Rapids was changing on January 1, 1985? Said differently, at what rate do you think people were being added to the population of Grand Rapids as of January 1, 1985? How many additional people should the city have expected in the following year? Why?         people.    In an average year the population grew by about people\/year.    The slope of a secant line through the points and .     people per year.              The change in population is people.    Since there were people added to Grand Rapids over the 20 years from 1980 to 2000, in an average year the population grew by people\/year.     measures the slope of a secant line through the points and .     people per year.     The units on each of these quantities are ``people per year''.       "

We can approximate the jumper's average velocity on the intervals and and find the average of these average velocities.

Now so the jumper's instantaneous velocity at is about feet per second.    The average velocities we calculated were all negative, while the instantaneous velocity was positive. When the jumper is moving in the downward direction, the average velocity will be negative (indicating a decrease in position), while a positive average velocity indicates an increase in position (moving upwards).

  "title": "The notion of limit",
  "body": " The notion of limit     What is the mathematical notion of limit and what role do limits play in the study of functions?    What is the meaning of the notation ?    How do we go about determining the value of the limit of a function at a point?    How do we manipulate average velocity to compute instantaneous velocity?      In Section 1.1 we used a function, , to model the location of a moving object at a given time. Functions can model other interesting phenomena, such as the rate at which an automobile consumes gasoline at a given velocity, or the reaction of a patient to a given dosage of a drug. We can use calculus to study how a function value changes in response to changes in the input variable.  Think about the falling ball whose position function is given by . Its average velocity on the interval is given by .  Note that the average velocity is a function of . That is, the function tells us the average velocity of the ball on the interval from to . To find the instantaneous velocity of the ball when , we need to know what happens to as gets closer and closer to . But also notice that is not defined, because it leads to the quotient .  This is where the notion of a limit comes in. By using a limit, we can investigate the behavior of as gets arbitrarily close, but not equal, to . We first use the graph of a function to explore points where interesting behavior occurs.    Suppose that is the function given by the graph below. Use the graph in Figure to answer each of the following questions.     Determine the values , , , , and , if defined. If the function value is not defined, explain what feature of the graph tells you this.    For each of the values , , and , complete the following sentence: As gets closer and closer (but not equal) to , gets as close as we want to .     What happens as gets closer and closer (but not equal) to ? Does the function get as close as we would like to a single value?      Graph of for Preview Activity .        The Notion of Limit  Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest. We need a precise understanding of what it means to say a function has limit as approaches . To begin, think about a recent example.  In Preview Activity , we saw that as gets closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, gets as close as we want to the value 4. At first, this may feel counterintuitive, because the value of is , not . But limits describe the behavior of a function arbitrarily close to a fixed input, and the value of the function at the fixed input does not matter. More formally, What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit. To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say as close to as we like and sufficiently close to . That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits. The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text. we say the following.    Given a function , a fixed input , and a real number , we say that has limit as approaches , limit definition and write provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . If we cannot make as close to a single value as we would like as approaches , then we say that does not have a limit as approaches .       For the function pictured in Figure , we make the following observations: . When working from a graph, it suffices to ask if the function approaches a single value from each side of the fixed input. The function value at the fixed input is irrelevant. This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.  However, does not have a limit as . There is a jump in the graph at . If we approach from the left, the function values tend to get close to 3, but if we approach from the right, the function values get close to 2. There is no single number that all of these function values approach. This is why the limit of does not exist at .    For any function , there are typically three ways to answer the question does have a limit at , and if so, what is the limit? The first is to reason graphically as we have just done with the example from Preview Activity . If we have a formula for , there are two additional possibilities:  Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach on either side (typically using some sort of computing technology), and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.  Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach .  The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit, while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.   Limits of Two Functions   For each of the following functions, we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated -values. Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and, if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit. Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.     ; ,    ; ,       a. We first construct a graph of along with tables of values near and .    Table of values near .                                           Table of values near .                                           Plot of on .     From Table , it appears that we can make as close as we want to 3 by taking sufficiently close to , which suggests that . This is also consistent with the graph of . To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view, consider the formula for : . As , , and , so as , the numerator of tends to 3 and the denominator tends to 1, hence .  The situation is more complicated when , because is not defined. If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator, we observe that as , , and , so as , the numerator and denominator of both tend to 0. We call an indeterminate form . indeterminate form This tells us that there is somehow more work to do. From Table and Figure , it appears that should have a limit of at .  To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that .  It is important to observe that, since we are taking the limit as , we are considering values that are close, but not equal, to . Because we never actually allow to equal , the quotient has value 1 for every possible value of . Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above, and find that . This limit is now easy to determine, and its value clearly is . Thus, from several points of view we've seen that .  b. Next we turn to the function , and construct two tables and a graph.    Table of values near .                                           Table of values near .                                           Plot of on .     First, as , it appears from the table values that the function is approaching a number between and . From the graph it appears that as . The exact value of is , which is approximately 0.8660254038. This is convincing evidence that .  As , we observe that does not behave in an elementary way. When is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and increases without bound. When is negative and approaching zero, decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to , the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of betweem and . If we plot the function with a graphing utility and then zoom in on , we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that does not have a limit at .  How do we reconcile the graph with the righthand table above, which seems to suggest that the limit of as approaches may in fact be ? The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values . When we evaluate , we get for each positive integer value of . But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero, say , then we find that .  That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is . Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit, so has no limit as .    An important lesson to take from Example is that tables can be misleading when determining the value of a limit. While a table of values is useful for investigating the possible value of a limit, we should also use other tools to confirm the value.    Estimate the value of each of the following limits by constructing appropriate tables of values. Then determine the exact value of the limit by using algebra to simplify the function. Finally, plot each function on an appropriate interval to check your result visually.           can be factored.  Expand the expression , and then combine like terms in the numerator.  Try multiplying the given function by this fancy form of 1: .        .  .  .      Estimating the values of the limits with tables is straightforward and should suggest the exact values stated below.     .   .   .      Recall that our primary motivation for considering limits of functions comes from our interest in studying the rate of change of a function. To that end, we close this section by revisiting our previous work with average and instantaneous velocity and highlighting the role that limits play.    Instantaneous Velocity  Suppose that we have a moving object whose position at time is given by a function . We know that the average velocity of the object on the time interval is . We define the instantaneous velocity  instantaneous velocity at to be the limit of average velocity as approaches . Note particularly that as , the length of the time interval gets shorter and shorter (while always including ). We will write for the instantaneous velocity at , and thus .  Equivalently, if we think of the changing value as being of the form , where is some small number, then we may instead write .  Again, the most important idea here is that to compute instantaneous velocity, we take a limit of average velocities as the time interval shrinks.    Consider a moving object whose position function is given by , where is measured in meters and is measured in minutes.     Determine the most simplified expression for the average velocity of the object on the interval , where .    Determine the average velocity of the object on the interval . Include units on your answer.   Determine the instantaneous velocity of the object when . Include units on your answer.        .  Recall that .  Consider and use your work in (a).        .  meters\/min.  meters per minute.        Observe that .  Using the expression just found in (a) with , meters\/min.  Taking the limit of average velocity and using our work from (a), we find that , so the instantaneous velocity of the object when is 6 meters per minute.      The closing activity of this section asks you to make some connections among average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and slopes of certain lines.    For the moving object whose position at time is given by the graph in Figure , answer each of the following questions. Assume that is measured in feet and is measured in seconds.   Plot of the position function in Activity .      Use the graph to estimate the average velocity of the object on each of the following intervals: , , . Draw each line whose slope represents the average velocity you seek.  How could you use average velocities or slopes of lines to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object at a fixed time?  Use the graph to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object when . Should this instantaneous velocity at be greater or less than the average velocity on that you computed in (a)? Why?        Remember that average velocity on an interval computes the quotient of change in over change in . This is the slope of the line between the corresponding two points on the graph of .  Think about shorter and shorter time intervals and drawing the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.  Think about zooming in on the graph at and drawing a line that, up close, looks just like the curve . What is the approximate slope of that line?         , , and .  Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity.  The instantaneous velocity at is greater than the average velocity on .        The average velocity on is the slope of the line joining the points and , which is . On , we similarly find , and on , we have .  Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity. For example, to estimate the instantaneous velocity at , we might consider average velocities on , , and .  If we draw the line through and , it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5: if we go over one grid-width, we appear to go up about 2.5. The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through and , which is 2. Hence the instantaneous velocity at is greater than the average velocity on .        Summary     Limits enable us to examine trends in function behavior near a specific point. In particular, taking a limit at a given point asks if the function values nearby tend to approach a particular fixed value.    We read , as the limit of as approaches is , which means that we can make the value of as close to as we want by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to .    To find for a given value of and a known function , we can estimate this value from the graph of , or we can make a table of function values for -values that are closer and closer to . If we want the exact value of the limit, we can work with the function algebraically to understand how different parts of the formula for change as .    We find the instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time by taking the limit of average velocities of the object over shorter and shorter time intervals containing the time of interest.       Limits on a piecewise graph   Use the figure below, which gives a graph of the function , to give values for the indicated limits. If a limit does not exist, enter none .   (a)  =  help (limits)  (b)  =  (c)  =  (d)  =                       (a) As approaches from either side, the values of get closer and closer to , so the limit appears to be about . (b) As approaches 0 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to . (Recall that to find a limit, we are interested in what happens to the function near but not at .) The limit appears to be about . (c) As approaches 1 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to on one side of and get closer and closer to on the other side of . Thus the limit does not exist. (d) As approaches 4 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to -2. (Again, recall that we don't care what happens right at .) The limit appears to be about -2.        Estimating a limit graphically   Use a graph to estimate the limit Note: is measured in radians. All angles will be in radians in this class unless otherwise specified.          , , the graph of is shown below. Therefore,       Limits for a piecewise formula   For the function use algebra to find each of the following limits:        (For each, enter DNE if the limit does not exist.)  Sketch a graph of to confirm your answers.                  is shown below. From this, and from the given formula for , we can see that , and . These are the same value, so we know that the limit must exist: . Note, however, that is not continuous at since .

By factoring the numerator and denominator of , we observe that . Taking the limit as , we take values closer and closer, but not equal to 2, and therefore , since for all . Finally, evaluating the last limit as , we see that .    False. In part (a), we saw that is not defined. We now know that has a limit of as approaches , but it is still the case that is undefined.

As such, the function values do not get arbitrarily close to a single value, and hence the limit does not exist.    We observe that whenever , and that whenever . So, if , we see that whereas if , it follows that . Because the function value is to the right of and to the left of , it follows that the limit does not exist.

To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view, consider the formula for : . As , , and , so as , the numerator of tends to 3 and the denominator tends to 1, hence .  The situation is more complicated when , because is not defined. If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator, we observe that as , , and , so as , the numerator and denominator of both tend to 0. We call an indeterminate form . indeterminate form This tells us that there is somehow more work to do. From Table and Figure , it appears that should have a limit of at .  To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that .  It is important to observe that, since we are taking the limit as , we are considering values that are close, but not equal, to . Because we never actually allow to equal , the quotient has value 1 for every possible value of . Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above, and find that . This limit is now easy to determine, and its value clearly is . Thus, from several points of view we've seen that .  b. Next we turn to the function , and construct two tables and a graph.

This is convincing evidence that .  As , we observe that does not behave in an elementary way. When is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and increases without bound. When is negative and approaching zero, decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to , the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of betweem and . If we plot the function with a graphing utility and then zoom in on , we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that does not have a limit at .  How do we reconcile the graph with the righthand table above, which seems to suggest that the limit of as approaches may in fact be ? The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values . When we evaluate , we get for each positive integer value of . But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero, say , then we find that .  That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is . Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit, so has no limit as .   "

How is the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a particular point defined? How is the instantaneous rate of change linked to average rate of change?    What is the derivative of a function at a given point? What does this derivative value measure? How do we interpret the derivative value graphically?    How are limits used formally in the computation of derivatives?      The instantaneous rate of change of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus. It is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and measures how fast a particular function is changing at a given point. If the original function represents the position of a moving object, this instantaneous rate of change is precisely the velocity of the object. In other contexts, instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day, the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed by increasing a car's velocity one mile per hour, or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate. The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph, and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.  Recall that for a moving object with position function , its average velocity on the time interval to is given by the quotient .  In a similar way, we make the following definition for an arbitrary function .    For a function , the average rate of change  average rate of change of on the interval is given by the value .    Equivalently, if we want to consider the average rate of change of on , we compute .  It is essential that you understand how the average rate of change of on an interval is connected to its graph.   Suppose that is the function given by the graph below and that and are the input values as labeled on the -axis. Use the graph in Figure to answer the following questions.   Plot of for Preview Activity .       Locate and label the points and on the graph.    Construct a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the line segment from to . What are the lengths of the respective legs of this triangle?    What is the slope of the line that connects the points and ?    Write a meaningful sentence that explains how the average rate of change of the function on a given interval and the slope of a related line are connected.        The Derivative of a Function at a Point  Just as we defined instantaneous velocity in terms of average velocity, we now define the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in terms of the average rate of change of the function over related intervals. This instantaneous rate of change of at  instantaneous rate of change is called the derivative of at , and is denoted by .    Let be a function and a value in the function's domain. We define the derivative of with respect to evaluated at , derivative definition denoted , by the formula , provided this limit exists.    Aloud, we read the symbol as either -prime at or the derivative of evaluated at . Much of the next several chapters will be devoted to understanding, computing, applying, and interpreting derivatives. For now, we observe the following important things.     The derivative of at the value is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of on the interval as . This limit may not exist, so not every function has a derivative at every point.  We say that a function is differentiable  differentiable at if it has a derivative at .  The derivative is a generalization of the instantaneous velocity of a position function: if is a position function of a moving body, tells us the instantaneous velocity of the body at time .  Because the units on are units of per unit of , the derivative has these very same units. For instance, if measures position in feet and measures time in seconds, the units on are feet per second.  Because the quantity represents the slope of the line through and , when we compute the derivative we are taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines. Thus, the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line.     We first consider the derivative at a given value as the slope of a certain line.  When we compute an instantaneous rate of change, we allow the interval to shrink as . We can think of one endpoint of the interval as sliding towards the other. In particular, provided that has a derivative at , the point will approach as . Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one, it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize it. One option is a java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving. For a helpful collection of examples, consider the work of David Austin of Grand Valley State University, and this particularly relevant example . For applets that have been built in Geogebra You can even consider building your own examples; the fantastic program Geogebra is available for free download and is easy to learn and use. , see Marc Renault's library via Shippensburg University, with this example being especially fitting for our work in this section.   Figure shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points and , generated by different values of . These lines (shown in the first three figures in magenta), are often called secant lines  secant line to the curve . A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve. For each such line, the slope of the secant line is , where the value of depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as , the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point . If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the tangent line to the curve. This tangent line tangent line (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of at the point has slope .   A sequence of secant lines approaching the tangent line to at .    If the tangent line at exists, the graph of looks like a straight line when viewed up close at .

Note how the tangent line sits relative to the curve at and how closely it resembles the curve near .   A sequence of secant lines approaching the tangent line to at . At right, we zoom in on the point . The slope of the tangent line (in green) to at is given by .

The following example demonstrates several key ideas involving the derivative of a function.   Using the limit definition of the derivative   For the function , use the limit definition of the derivative to compute . In addition, discuss the meaning of this value and draw a labeled graph that supports your explanation.    From the limit definition, we know that .  Now we use the rule for , and observe that and . Substituting these values into the limit definition, we have that .  In order to let , we must simplify the quotient. Expanding and distributing in the numerator, .  Combining like terms, we have .  Next, we remove a common factor of in both the numerator and denominator and find that .  Finally, we are able to take the limit as , and thus conclude that . We note that is the instantaneous rate of change of at the point . It is also the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at the point .

What is the difference between writing and ?    How is the graph of the derivative function related to the graph of ?    What are some examples of functions for which is not defined at one or more points?      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function at , or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at , is given by the value . In all of our examples so far, we have identified a particular value of as our point of interest: , , etc. But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one -value, and possibly for many of them. In this section, we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for at any point . Indeed, the process of taking the derivative generates a new function, denoted by , derived from the original function .   Consider the function .   Use the limit definition to compute the derivative values: , , , and .    Observe that the work to find is the same, regardless of the value of . Based on your work in (a), what do you conjecture is the value of ? How about ? (Note: you should not use the limit definition of the derivative to find either value.)    Conjecture a formula for that depends only on the value . That is, in the same way that we have a formula for (recall ), see if you can use your work above to guess a formula for in terms of .        How the derivative is itself a function  In your work in Preview Activity with , you may have found several patterns. One comes from observing that , , , and . That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that and . We also observe that the particular value of has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition. To see this more clearly, we compute , where represents a number to be named later. Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative, .  Here we observe that neither nor depend on the value of , so as , . Thus, .  This result is consistent with the specific values we found above: e.g., . And indeed, our work confirms that the value of has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative. We note further that the letter being used is immaterial: whether we call it , , or anything else, the derivative at a given value is simply given by 4 minus 2 times the value. We choose to use for consistency with the original function given by , as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function. For the function , it follows that .  Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function, it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.   The graphs of (at left) and (at right). Slopes on the graph of correspond to heights on the graph of .    In Figure , on the left we show a plot of together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we've considered above. On the right, we show a plot of with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: the slope of the tangent line at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the height at the corresponding point on the righthand graph. That is, at each respective value of , the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of . On the righthand graph of , the units on the vertical axis are units of per unit of .  An excellent way to explore how the graph of generates the graph of is through an applet. See, for instance, the applets at gvsu.edu\/s\/5C or gvsu.edu\/s\/5D , via the sites of David Austin and Marc Renault .  In Section when we first defined the derivative, we wrote the definition in terms of a value to find . As we have seen above, the letter is merely a placeholder, and it often makes more sense to use instead. For the record, here we restate the definition of the derivative. derivative definition     Let be a function and a value in the function's domain. We define the derivative of , a new function called , by the formula , provided this limit exists.    We now have two different ways of thinking about the derivative function:  given a graph of , how does this graph lead to the graph of the derivative function ? and  given a formula for , how does the limit definition of derivative generate a formula for ?  Both of these issues are explored in the following activities.    For each given graph of , sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function, , on the axes immediately below. The scale of the grid for the graph of is ; assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of is identical to that for . If necessary, adjust and label the vertical scale on the axes for .  When you are finished with all 8 graphs, write several sentences that describe your overall process for sketching the graph of the derivative function, given the graph the original function. What are the values of the derivative function that you tend to identify first? What do you do thereafter? How do key traits of the graph of the derivative function exemplify properties of the graph of the original function?                Points where the slope of the tangent line is equal to zero are particularly important. Try finding these points first in your effort to plot and plotting those zero values on the axes where you'll graph .                                For a dynamic investigation that allows you to experiment with graphing when given the graph of , see this appled by Marc Renault .  Now, recall the opening example of this section: we began with the function and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that , or equivalently that . We subsequently graphed the functions and as shown in Figure . Following Activity , we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of  without knowing a formula for either or . At the same time, it is useful to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.  In the next activity, we further explore the more algebraic approach to finding : given a formula for , the limit definition of the derivative will be used to develop a formula for .    For each of the listed functions, determine a formula for the derivative function. For the first two, determine the formula for the derivative by thinking about the nature of the given function and its slope at various points; do not use the limit definition. For the latter four, use the limit definition. Pay careful attention to the function names and independent variables. It is important to be comfortable with using letters other than and . For example, given a function , we call its derivative .                                       What is the slope of the function at every point?    What is the slope of the function at every point?                               .     .     .     .     .     .           because the slope of the tangent line to the horizontal line given by is zero at every value of .     because the slope of the tangent line to the line given by is 1 at every value of .                     Summary     The limit definition of the derivative, , produces a value for each at which the derivative is defined, and this leads to a new function . It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function ( ) and produces a new, related function ( ).    There is essentially no difference between writing (as we did regularly in Section ) and writing . In either case, the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.    Given the graph of a function , we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative by observing that heights on the derivative's graph correspond to slopes on the original function's graph.    In Activity , we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs, such as the shifted absolute value function. At such points, the derivative fails to exist, and we say that is not differentiable there. For now, it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.       The derivative function graphically   Consider the function shown in the graph below.   (Note that you can click on the graph to get a larger version of it, and that it may be useful to print that larger version to be able to work with it by hand.)  Carefully sketch the derivative function of the given function (you will want to estimate values on the derivative function at different values as you do this). Use your derivative function graph to estimate the following values on the derivative function.    at  -3  -1  1  3    the derivative is                             , we estimate the derivative by estimating the slope (=rise\/run) from the graph. This allows us to both sketch the graph of the derivative and estimate the derivatives that are requested. The derivative (in red) is shown with the original function (in blue) below. From the graph and our calculations, it appears that , , , and .      Applying the limit definition of the derivative   Find a formula for the derivative of the function using difference quotients:      .  (In the first answer blank, fill in the numerator of the difference quotient you use to evaluate the derivative. In the second, fill out the derivative you obtain after completing the limit calculation.)                     Sketching the derivative   For the function shown in the graph below, sketch a graph of the derivative. You will then be picking which of the following is the correct derivative graph, but should be sure to first sketch the derivative yourself.   Which of the following graphs is the derivative of ?   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    (Click on a graph to enlarge it.)    1.  2.  3.  4.    5.  6.  7.  8.          , we know that the derivative is negative where is decreasing and positive where it is increasing. Applying this to , we see that the derivative must be which is answer 3.      Comparing function and derivative values   The graph of a function is shown below.   At which of the labeled -values is  least?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    greatest?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    least?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    greatest?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6                         are those locations where the vertical coordinate on the graph is the smallest and largest, which are x4 and x6, respectively. The smallest and largest values of the derivative are where the slope of the function is smallest and largest, which are x3 and x5.

The fact that is differentiable everywhere means that the graph of is smooth everywhere. The slopes of the tangent lines to are negative but increasing on the interval and positive and increasing on the interval , with a slope of when . This is the kind of behavior that a quadratic function possesses, so we could guess that has a graph something like that shown in the figure below.    Because the change in the derivative values is constant, it looks like is linear with a slope of , passing through the point , so it is reasonable to guess that . A plot of is shown at right in the figure below.       A natural guess is ; since we need the function to pass through the point , we might try . Using the limit definition, we have . So this guess is close, but is off by a factor of , since we want . Instead, if we use (note that we chose the `` '' so that , then we have . This appears to be the correct function .       Consider the function .   Use the limit definition of the derivative to determine a formula for .

Compare and contrast the formulas for and you have found. How do the constants 5, 4, 12, and 3 affect the results?          .          .    The constants and don't seem to affect the results at all. The coefficient on the linear term in appears to make the `` '' appear in . The leading coefficient in leads to the coefficient of `` '' in .         By definition, .       In the above figure, we see plots of both and . We observe that the point is the vertex of the quadratic function , and at this point the slope of the tangent line to is zero. This aligns with the point where crosses the -axis. In addition, we note that is negative for , which corresponds to where is decreasing and has tangent lines with slopes that are negative. Similarly, the values of are positive for , which align with the values of slopes we see on the original function .    By definition, .    For , we found that . For , we determined that . The constants and don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of and vertically, which does nothing to change the slope. The coefficient on the linear term in appears to make the `` '' appear in . That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function , the slope would everywhere be , in contrast to the coefficent found on the linear term in , which leads to the constant in . Finally, the leading coefficient in leads to the coefficient of `` '' in . This makes sense because if we considered only , the would make the graph times as steep as the graph of , and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.       Let be a continuous function (that is, one with no jumps or holes in the graph) and suppose that a graph of is given by the graph on the right in Figure .   Axes for plotting and, at right, the graph of .       Observe that for every value of that satisfies , the value of is constant. What does this tell you about the behavior of the graph of on this interval?    On what intervals other than do you expect to be a linear function? Why?    At which values of is not defined? What behavior does this lead you to expect to see in the graph of ?    Suppose that . On the axes provided at left in Figure , sketch an accurate graph of .          is linear.    On , and .    At ; must have sharp corners at these points.              Since is constant (with value ) on the interval , it follows that is linear on that same interval, since is increasing at a constant rate.    On , we also expect to be linear with slope , while on and , will be linear with slope ; in each case this is true because the value of is constant with the noted value on the interval.    From the given graph of , we observe that is undefined at . Since we have been given that is a continuous function, we can conclude that must have sharp corners on its graph at these points. Moreover, that makes sense in light of our earlier observations that show has constant slope on the intervals that connect at and the graph jumps from having slope to , and then back, and so on.            For each graph that provides an original function in Figure , your task is to sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function, , on the axes immediately below. View the scale of the grid for the graph of as being , and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of is identical to that for . If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of , you should label that accordingly.   Graphs of and grids for plotting the corresponding graph of .                     At any point where there is a jump in the graph of the derivative, the derivative is undefined.

  "body": " Interpreting, estimating, and using the derivative     In contexts other than the position of a moving object, what does the derivative of a function measure?    What are the units on the derivative function , and how are they related to the units of the original function ?    What is a central difference, and how can one be used to estimate the value of the derivative at a point from given function data?    Given the value of the derivative of a function at a point, what can we infer about how the value of the function changes nearby?      It is a powerful feature of mathematics that it can be studied both as abstract discipline and as an applied one. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions. At the same time, if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes, calculus can describe our experience of physical reality. We have already seen that for the position function of a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the derivative of the position function, , gives the ball's velocity at time .  In this section, we investigate several functions with specific physical meaning, and consider how the units on the independent variable, dependent variable, and the derivative function add to our understanding. To start, we consider the familiar problem of a position function of a moving object.   One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North America can be found on the Great Plains in the state of North Dakota on state highway 46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle. A car leaves town (at time ) and heads east on highway 46; its position in miles from Gackle at time in minutes is given by the graph of the function in Figure . Three important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, assume that it is indeed a straight line.   The graph of , the position of the car along highway 46, which tells its distance in miles from Gackle, ND, at time in minutes.       In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval. In particular, discuss what is happening on the time intervals and .    Find the slope of the line between the points and . What are the units on this slope? What does the slope represent?    Find the average rate of change of the car's position on the interval . Include units on your answer.    Estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the car's position at the moment . Write a sentence to explain your reasoning and the meaning of this value.        Units of the derivative function  As we now know, the derivative of the function at a fixed value is given by , and this value has several different interpretations. If we set , one meaning of is the slope of the tangent line at the point .  We also sometimes write or instead of , and these alternate notations help us see the units (and thus the meaning) of the derivative as the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to . instantaneous rate of change The units on the slope of the secant line, , are units of per unit of , and when we take the limit as goes to zero, the derivative has the same units: units of per unit of . It is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are units of output per unit of input, for the variables of the original function.  For example, suppose that the function measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year (where corresponds to 2010 AD). We are told that . What is the meaning of this value? Well, since is measured in thousands and is measured in years, we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year. We therefore expect that in the coming year, about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.    Toward more accurate derivative estimates  Recall that to estimate the value of at a given , we calculate a difference quotient  difference quotient  with a relatively small value of . We should use both positive and negative values of in order to account for the behavior of the function on both sides of the point of interest. To that end, we introduce the notion of a central difference and its role in estimating derivatives.    Suppose that is a function for which three values are known: , , and . Estimate .    We know that . But since we don't have a graph or a formula for the function, we can neither sketch a tangent line nor evaluate the limit algebraically. We can't even use smaller and smaller values of to estimate the limit. Instead, we have just two choices: using or , depending on which point we pair with .  So, one estimate is .  The other is .  Because the first approximation looks backward from the point and the second approximation looks forward, it makes sense to average these two estimates in order to account for behavior on both sides of . Doing so, we find that .    The intuitive approach to average the two estimates found in Example is in fact the best possible way estimate to a derivative when we have just two function values for on opposite sides of the point of interest.   At left, the graph of along with the secant line through and , the secant line through and , as well as the tangent line. At right, the same graph along with the secant line through and , plus the tangent line.    To see why, we think about the diagram in Figure . On the left, we see the two secant lines with slopes that come from computing the backward difference  backward difference  and from the forward difference  forward difference  . Note how the first slope over-estimates the slope of the tangent line at , while the second slope underestimates . On the right, we see the secant line whose slope is given by the central difference  central difference  .  Note that this central difference has the same value as the average of the forward and backward differences (and it is straightforward to explain why this always holds). The central difference yields a very good approximation to the derivative's value, because it yields a line closer to being parallel to the tangent line.  The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by . This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to through the points and .    A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes.

Without doing any calculation, which do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Suppose it is given that and . What are the units on these two quantities? What do you expect the temperature of the potato to be when ? when ? Why?    Write a couple of careful sentences that describe the behavior of the temperature of the potato on the time interval , as well as the behavior of the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature of the potato on the same time interval.          Think about quantities such as .    See the note in (a).    Is changing faster at or at ?    Remember that the units on will be degrees Fahrenheit per minute.     Be careful to distinguish between the temperature, , and the rate of change of temperature, , in your commentary.           degrees per minute.     degrees per minute.     .    The value is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant , and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at , the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at , or in other words . Similarly, at , two minutes have elapsed from , so we expect an increase of degrees: .    Throughout the time interval , the temperature of the potato is increasing. But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing. That is, while the values of continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.           Using the central difference, we find that degrees per minute.    Using the central difference, we find that degrees per minute.    Over each subsequent time interval, we see that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less, thus we expect the value of to get smaller and smaller as time goes on. We therefore expect .    The value is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant , and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at , the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at , or in other words . Similarly, at , two minutes have elapsed from , so we expect an increase of degrees: .    Throughout the time interval , the temperature of the potato is increasing. But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing. That is, while the values of continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.          A company manufactures rope, and the total cost of producing feet of rope is dollars.

Do you think is less than, equal to, or greater than ? Why?    Suppose someone claims that . What would the practical meaning of this derivative value tell you about the approximate cost of the next foot of rope? Is this possible? Why or why not?          The cost of producing 2000 feet of rope is     Remember that the units on any derivative are units of output per unit of input.     How much do you expect to increase for each additional foot away from 2000? By how many feet will the input increase to get to 2100?    In manufacturing processes, there is often a decrease in cost per unit as the number of units increases.    Is it possible for the total cost function to be decreasing at some point?          It costs $800 to make 2000 feet of rope.     dollars per foot.      ,.    Either or .    Impossible. The total cost function can never decrease.           means that it costs $800 to make 2000 feet of rope.    The units of are dollars per foot.     If and , then we know once 2000 feet of rope are produced, the total cost function is increasing at $0.35 per additional foot of rope. Then, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope, the additional total cost will be approximately . Therefore, we find that , or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about $835.    Either or , since we expect the cost per foot of additional rope to either stay constant or to get smaller as the production volume increases. Said differently, the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.    It is impossible to have and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function. The total cost function can never decrease, because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.         Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car. In particular, they have determined that the consumption , in liters per kilometer , at a given speed , is given by a function , where is the car's speed in kilometers per hour .   Data provided by the car company tells us that , , and . Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at . Be as accurate as possible, use proper notation, and include units on your answer.    By writing a complete sentence, interpret the meaning (in the context of fuel consumption) of .     Write at least one complete sentence that interprets the meaning of the value of that you estimated in (a).          Try a central difference.    What is happening when the car is traveling at 80 km\/hr?    Remember that units on the derivative are units of output per unit of input.            liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.    At 80 kilometers per hour, the car is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer.    When the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.          Using a central difference, we have which tells us that liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.    When the car is traveling at 80 kilometers per hour, it is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer. That is, at the given speed, for each additional kilometer the car travels, it uses an additional 0.015 liters of fuel.    To say that liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour means that when the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour. If we increase our speed from 90 to 91 km\/hr, we would expect our rate of fuel consumption to rise by 0.0006 liters for each additional kilometer driven.       In Section , we learned how use to the graph of a given function to plot the graph of its derivative, . It is important to remember that when we do so, the scale and the units on the vertical axis often have to change to represent . For example, suppose that tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time in minutes. In Figure , we sketch the graph of on the left and the graph of on the right.   Plot of at left, and its derivative at right.    Notice that the vertical scales are different in size and different in units, as the units of are F, while those of are F\/min.    Summary     The derivative of a given function measures the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.    The units on the derivative function are units of per unit of . Again, this measures how fast the output of the function changes when the input of the function changes.    The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by . This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to through the points and . The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value.

Thus we can complete the statement: At 35 minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its temperature is 68 degC and will decrease by about 0.75 degC in the next 30 seconds.

(b) In the statement ,  what are the units of 2000?   lb    cal    day    lb\/cal    cal\/lb    cal\/day    lb\/day    day\/lb    day\/cal    what are the units of 0?   lb    cal    day    lb\/cal    cal\/lb    cal\/day    lb\/day    day\/lb    day\/cal    (Think about what this statement means in terms of the weight of the subject and the number of calories that the subject consumes.)

(d) What are the units of ?   lb    cal    day    lb\/cal    cal\/lb    cal\/day    lb\/day    day\/lb    day\/cal    (e) Suppose that Sam reads about in this study and draws the following conclusion: If Sam increases her average calorie intake from 2800 to 2840 calories per day, then her weight will increase by approximately 0.8 pounds.  Fill in the blanks below so that the equation supports her conclusion.                                                    where is weight in pounds and is the number of Calories consumed per day: (a)  means that consuming 1600 cal each day results in a weight of 165 lb (the units of 1600 are cal, and 165 lb). (b)  means that consuming 2000 cal each day causes neither weight gain nor loss (the units of the 2000 are cal, and 0 lb\/cal). (c)  means that a weight of 173 lb is caused by a consumption of 2400 cal each day (the units of 173 are lb, and 2400 cal). (d) The units of are lb\/cal (e) Based on Sam's conclusion, should equal .      Displacement and velocity   The displacement (in meters) of a particle moving in a straight line is given by where is measured in seconds.  (A)  (i) Find the average velocity over the time interval [3,4].  Average Velocity = meters per second.  (ii) Find the average velocity over the time interval [3.5,4].  Average Velocity = meters per second.  (iii) Find the average velocity over the time interval [4,5].  Average Velocity = meters per second.  (iv) Find the average velocity over the time interval [4,4.5].  Average Velocity = meters per second.  (B) Find the instantaneous velocity when .  Instantaneous velocity = meters per second.                                 A cup of coffee has its temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at time given by the function , where time is measured in minutes.   Use a central difference with to estimate the value of .    What are the units on the value of that you computed in (a)? What is the practical meaning of the value of ?    Which do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Write a sentence that describes the behavior of the function on the time interval . How do you think its graph will look? Why?          .    The coffee's temperature is decreasing at about degrees per minute.     .    We expect to get closer and closer to as time goes on.         Using the central difference formula, we find that .    Since is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and in minutes, we have degrees F per minute. This means that at the instant , the temperature of the coffee is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of about degrees per minute. Said differently, in the next minute, we'd expect the temperature of the coffee to drop about degrees.    We expect the coffee's temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee's temperature to approach that of the surrounding room. Keeping in mind that is an always decreasing function so that is always negative, we observe that should be less (more negative) than . These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of .    We have noted that is always negative, and that we expect to get closer and closer to as time goes on (that is, is increasing). As such, we expect to look something like the graph of . This is reasonable since is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches as increases.       The temperature change (in Fahrenheit degrees), in a patient, that is generated by a dose (in milliliters), of a drug, is given by the function .   What does it mean to say ? Write a complete sentence to explain, using correct units.    A person's sensitivity, , to the drug is defined by the function . What are the units of sensitivity?    Suppose that . Write a complete sentence to explain the meaning of this value. Include in your response the information given in (a).         If a patient takes a dose of ml of a drug, the patient will experience a body temperature change of degrees F.    ``degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter.''    For a patient taking a ml dose, adding one more ml to the dose leads us to expect a temperature change that is about degrees less than the temperature change induced by a ml dose.         To say that means that if a patient takes a dose of ml of a drug, the patient will experience a body temperature change of degrees F.    Since the units of are degrees F and the units of are ml, it follows that the units of are ``degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter.''    If degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter, this means that the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature change function is degrees F per ml at the dose-level of ml. This means that for a patient taking a ml dose, adding one more ml to the dose leads us to expect a temperature change that is about degrees less than the temperature change induced by a ml dose.       The velocity of a ball that has been tossed vertically in the air is given by , where is measured in feet per second, and is measured in seconds. The ball is in the air from until .   When is the ball's velocity greatest?    Determine the value of . Justify your thinking.    What are the units on the value of ? What does this value and the corresponding units tell you about the behavior of the ball at time ?    What is the physical meaning of the function ?          .     .    ``feet per second per second''; tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second.    The acceleration of the ball.         Observe that is a linear function with negative slope , and thus decreasing. Since the function is of interest from to , the velocity is greatest at the left endpoint, when . This greatest velocity is feet per second.    Since is a linear function, its slope is constant, and hence the slope of every tangent line to the function is the same as the slope of the line the function generates. Thus, .    Because is measured in feet per second and in seconds, the units on are ``feet per second per second.'' Knowing that , this tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball's velocity is at , we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) feet per second over the next one second. (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)    The instantaneous rate of change of velocity is precisely the acceleration of the ball. Indeed, tells us how the ball's velocity changes, and that it does so at a constant rate of feet per second per second. This is also consistent with the fact that acceleration due to gravity is constant.       The value, , of a particular automobile (in dollars) depends on the number of miles, , the car has been driven, according to the function .   Suppose that and . What is the average rate of change of on the interval , and what are the units on this value?    In addition to the information given in (a), say that . Determine the best possible estimate of and write one sentence to explain the meaning of your result, including units on your answer.    Which value do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Write a sentence to describe the long-term behavior of the function , plus another sentence to describe the long-term behavior of . Provide your discussion in practical terms regarding the value of the car and the rate at which that value is changing.          dollars per mile.     dollars per mile. During st mile, we expect the car's value to drop by dollars.     .    The graph of might have the general shape of the graph of for positive values of : always positive, always decreasing, and bending upwards while tending to as increases.         To find the average rate of change of on the interval , we divide the change in values (in dollars) on this interval by the change in values (in miles) to obtain dollars per mile. This tells us that from the mileage of to miles, on average the car's value decreases by dollars per mile driven.    Since and are equidistant from , we use the central difference quotient to approximate the derivative of at to obtain dollars per mile. This approximation tells us that at the instant the car has been driven miles, the car's value is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of dollars per mile. That is, during st mile, we'd expect the car's value to drop by dollars.    As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of is increasing (becoming less negative) as increases and that .    The value of a car is never negative. So we know that for all . A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that for all . The fact that the depreciation slows as increases implies that is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since is increasing, it follows that is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of might have the general shape of the graph of for positive values of .       "

  "title": "The second derivative",
  "body": " The second derivative     How does the derivative of a function tell us whether the function is increasing or decreasing on an interval?    What can we learn by taking the derivative of the derivative (the second derivative) of a function ?    What does it mean to say that a function is concave up or concave down? How are these characteristics connected to certain properties of the derivative of the function?    What are the units of the second derivative? How do they help us understand the rate of change of the rate of change?      Given a differentiable function , we know that its derivative, , is a related function whose output at tells us the slope of the tangent line to at the point . That is, heights on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.  At a point where is positive, the slope of the tangent line to is positive. Therefore, on an interval where is positive, the function is increasing (or rising). increasing Similarly, if is negative on an interval, the graph of is decreasing decreasing (or falling).  The derivative of tells us not only whether the function is increasing or decreasing on an interval, but also how the function is increasing or decreasing. Look at the two tangent lines shown in Figure . We see that near point the value of is positive and relatively close to zero, and near that point the graph is rising slowly. By contrast, near point , the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value, and is decreasing rapidly near .   Two tangent lines on a graph.    Besides asking whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether it is large or small, we can also ask how is the derivative changing?   Because the derivative, , is itself a function, we can consider taking its derivative the derivative of the derivative and ask what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves? We start with an investigation of a moving object.   The position of a car driving along a straight road at time in minutes is given by the function that is pictured in Figure . The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. For instance, the point on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes, the car has traveled 4000 feet.   The graph of , the position of the car (measured in thousands of feet from its starting location) at time in minutes.       In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval. In particular, you should carefully discuss what is happening on each of the time intervals , , , , and , plus provide commentary overall on what the car is doing on the interval .    On the lefthand axes provided in Figure , sketch a careful, accurate graph of .    What is the meaning of the function in the context of the given problem? What can we say about the car's behavior when is positive? when is zero? when is negative?    Rename the function you graphed in (b) to be called . Describe the behavior of in words, using phrases like is increasing on the interval and is constant on the interval .     Sketch a graph of the function on the righthand axes provide in Figure . Write at least one sentence to explain how the behavior of is connected to the graph of .      Axes for plotting and .       Increasing or decreasing  So far, we have used the words increasing and decreasing intuitively to describe a function's graph. Here we define these terms more formally.    Given a function defined on the interval , we say that is increasing on provided that for all , in the interval , if , then . Similarly, we say that is decreasing on provided that for all , in the interval , if , then .    Simply put, an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph, and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases. If the function has a derivative, the sign of the derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing.  Let be a function that is differentiable on an interval . It is possible to show that if for every such that , then is increasing on ; similarly, if on , then is decreasing on .  For example, the function pictured in Figure is increasing on the entire interval , and decreasing on the interval . Note that the value is not included in either interval since at this location, the function is changing from increasing to decreasing.   A function that is decreasing on the intervals and and increasing on and .      The Second Derivative  second derivative  We are now accustomed to investigating the behavior of a function by examining its derivative. The derivative of a function is a new function given by the rule .  Because is itself a function, it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative, which is the new function . We call this resulting function the second derivative  second derivative of , and denote the second derivative by . Consequently, we will sometimes call  the first derivative of , rather than simply the derivative of .    The second derivative is defined by the limit definition of the derivative of the first derivative. That is, .    The meaning of the derivative function still holds, so when we compute , this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve , as well as the instantaneous rate of change of . In other words, just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes, the second derivative measures the rate at which the first derivative changes. The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.    Concavity  In addition to asking whether a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire how a function is increasing or decreasing. There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured in Figure : the function can increase more and more rapidly, it can increase at the same rate, or it can increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.   Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.    On the leftmost curve in Figure , draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve. As we move from left to right, the slopes of those tangent lines will increase. Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing, and this explains why we say this function is increasing at an increasing rate . For the rightmost graph in Figure , observe that as increases, the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease. This function is increasing at a decreasing rate .  Similar options hold for how a function can decrease. Here we must be extra careful with our language, because decreasing functions involve negative slopes. Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language. For example, it can be tempting to say that is bigger than . But we must remember that greater than describes how numbers lie on a number line: provided that lies to the right of . So of course, is less than . Informally, it might be helpful to say that is more negative than . When a function's values are negative, and those values get more negative as the input increases, the function must be decreasing.   From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.    Now consider the three graphs shown in Figure . Clearly the middle graph depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate. Now, on the first curve, draw a sequence of tangent lines. We see that the slopes of these lines get less and less negative as we move from left to right. That means that the values of the first derivative, while all negative, are increasing, and thus we say that the leftmost curve is decreasing at an increasing rate .  This leaves only the rightmost curve in Figure to consider. For that function, the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval, but as we move from left to right, the slopes get more and more negative. Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing, and we say that the function is decreasing at a decreasing rate .  We now introduce the notion of concavity  concavity which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors. When a curve opens upward on a given interval, like the parabola or the exponential growth function , we say that the curve is concave up on that interval. Likewise, when a curve opens down, like the parabola or the opposite of the exponential function , we say that the function is concave down . Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.  In Figure , we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each. On the lefthand plot, where the function is concave up, observe that the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right. In other words, the function is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, , is increasing on that interval. Similarly, on the righthand plot in Figure , where the function shown is concave down, we see that the tangent lines always lie above the curve, and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right. The fact that its derivative, , is decreasing makes concave down on the interval.   At left, a function that is concave up; at right, one that is concave down.    We state these most recent observations formally as the definitions of the terms concave up and concave down .    Let be a differentiable function on an interval . Then is concave up  concave up on if and only if is increasing on ; is concave down  concave down on if and only if is decreasing on .      The position of a car driving along a straight road at time in minutes is given by the function that is pictured in Figure . The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. Remember that you worked with this function and sketched graphs of and in Preview Activity .   The graph of , the position of the car (measured in thousands of feet from its starting location) at time in minutes.       On what intervals is the position function increasing? decreasing? Why?    On which intervals is the velocity function increasing? decreasing? neither? Why?     Acceleration  acceleration is defined to be the instantaneous rate of change of velocity, as the acceleration of an object measures the rate at which the velocity of the object is changing. Say that the car's acceleration function is named . How is computed from ? How is computed from ? Explain.    What can you say about whenever is increasing? Why?    Using only the words increasing , decreasing , constant , concave up , concave down , and linear , complete the following sentences. For the position function with velocity and acceleration ,   on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .    on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .    on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .             Remember that a function is increasing on an interval if and only if its first derivative is positive on the interval.    See (a).    Remember that the first derivative of a function measures its instantaneous rate of change.    Think about how .    Be very careful with your letters: , , and .          Increasing: , , , and . Decreasing: never.    Velocity is increasing on , , , and ; is decreasing on , , , and . Velocity is constant on , , and .     and .     is positive since is increasing.        increasing .     decreasing .     constant .     increasing .     decreasing .     constant .     concave up .     concave down .     linear .             The position function increasing on the intervals , , , and , because at every point in such intervals, is positive. For the provided function, is never decreasing because its derivative is never negative.    The velocity function appears to be increasing on the intervals , , , and because the curve is concave up which corresponds to an increasing first derivative . Similarly, appears to be decreasing on the intervals , , , and because the curve is concave down which corresponds to a decreasing first derivative . On the intervals , , and , the position function is constant, and thus linear, so neither concave up nor concave down. This also corresponds to the velocity being constant (since ) on these intervals.    Since is the instantaneous rate of change of , . And because , it follows that , so acceleration is the second derivative of position.    Because is the first derivative of , when is increasing, must be positive.    For the position function with velocity and acceleration ,   on an interval where is positive, is increasing .    on an interval where is negative, is decreasing .    on an interval where is zero, is constant .    on an interval where is positive, is increasing .    on an interval where is negative, is decreasing .    on an interval where is zero, is constant .    on an interval where is positive, is concave up .    on an interval where is negative, is concave down .    on an interval where is zero, is linear .          Exploring the context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent way to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In Activity , we can replace , , and with an arbitrary function and its derivatives and , and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that the following are equivalent: on an interval where the graph of is concave up, is increasing and is positive. Likewise, on an interval where the graph of is concave down, is decreasing and is negative.    A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes. In Activity , we computed approximations to and using central differences. Those values are provided in the second table below, along with several others computed in the same way.    Select values of .                                      Select values of .         NA                         NA         What are the units on the values of ?    Use a central difference to estimate the value of .    What is the meaning of the value of that you have computed in (b) in terms of the potato's temperature? Write several careful sentences that discuss, with appropriate units, the values of , , and , and explain the overall behavior of the potato's temperature at this point in time.    Overall, is the potato's temperature increasing at an increasing rate, increasing at a constant rate, or increasing at a decreasing rate? Why?          Remember that the derivative's units are units of output per unit of input.     To estimate , we can use for an appropriate choice of .    For each of the values and , think about what they tell you about expected upcoming behavior in and , respectively.    Think concavity.          Degrees Fahrenheit per minute.     .    At the moment , the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees; its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute; and the rate at which the temperature is rising is falling at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute.    Increasing at a decreasing rate.           has units measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute.    Using a central difference, .    The value , which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment , the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is falling at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute. That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate. At , we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.    The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of are falling. Equivalently, this is because the value of is negative throughout the given time interval.         This activity builds on our experience and understanding of how to sketch the graph of given the graph of .  In Figure , given the respective graphs of two different functions , sketch the corresponding graph of on the first axes below, and then sketch on the second set of axes. In addition, for each, write several careful sentences in the spirit of those in Activity that connect the behaviors of , , and . For instance, write something such as    is on the interval , which is connected to the fact that is on the same interval , and is on the interval.   but of course with the blanks filled in. Throughout, view the scale of the grid for the graph of as being , and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of is identical to that for . If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of or , you should label that accordingly.   Two given functions , with axes provided for plotting and below.      Remember that to plot , it is helpful to first identify where .         The graphs of and are plotted below.         Summary     A differentiable function is increasing on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive, and decreasing whenever its first derivative is negative.    By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function , we arrive at the second derivative, . The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative. The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to is increasing or decreasing.    A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is positive), and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is negative). Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are and ; examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are and .    The units on the second derivative are units of output per unit of input per unit of input. They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input. In other words, the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.       Comparing values   Consider the function graphed below.   For this function, are the following nonzero quantities positive or negative?  is   positive    negative    is   positive    negative    is   positive    negative    (Because this is a multiple choice problem, it will not show which parts of the problem are correct or incorrect when you submit it.)                  -axis at , the value of is positive. Since is increasing at , the value of is positive. Since is concave down at , the value of is negative.

The sign of is determined by the slope of the function at the point: if the function is increasing, then ; if it is decreasing, , and if it is neither increasing nor decreasing, then . Similarly, the sign of is determined by the concavity of the function: if the function is concave up, then , if it is concave down, .

How many real number solutions can there be to the equation ? Justify your conclusion fully and carefully by explaining what you know about how the graph of must behave based on the given graph of .

From the given graph of , we may estimate that .    Observe that is always positive. This tells us that must be always increasing. Therefore, it follows that may cross the -axis at most one time, and hence there can be at most one solution to .    On , changes concavity times, since changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing times. Whenever is increasing, is positive, and whenever is decreasing, is negative. Hence, whenever changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it follows that changes sign, and this causes a change in the concavity of . We therefore see that while is always increasing, changes concavity many times.    From the given graph of , we can see that and . Using a central difference, it follows that .

Thus, The bungee jumper is rising most rapidly at , at a rate of about feet per second.    We again use a central difference, this time to estimate . Observe that      measures the acceleration of the bungee jumper at . Thus we know that the person's acceleration at is about feet per second per second. This measures the instantaneous rate of change of the jumper's velocity.    The bungee jumper's position function is concave down on approximately the intervals , . This is easiest to see if we plot the data using a program like Excel.

How is this connected to having a left-hand limit at and having a right-hand limit at ?    What does it mean to say that a function is continuous at ? What role do limits play in determining whether or not a function is continuous at a point?    What does it mean graphically to say that a function is differentiable at ? How is this connected to the function being locally linear?    How are the characteristics of a function having a limit, being continuous, and being differentiable at a given point related to one another?      In Section , we learned how limits can be used to study the trend of a function near a fixed input value. In this section, we aim to quantify how the function acts and how its values change near a particular point. If the function has a limit at , we will consider how the value of the function is related to , and whether or not the function has a derivative at .   A function is given by the graph in Figure . Use the graph to answer each of the following questions. Note: to the right of , the graph of is exhibiting infinite oscillatory behavior similar to the function that we encountered in the key example early in Section . Assume that .     For each of the values , determine whether or not exists. If the function has a limit at a given point, state the value of the limit using the notation . If the function does not have a limit at a given point, write a sentence to explain why.    For each of the values of from part (a) where has a limit, determine the value of at each such point. In addition, for each such value, does have the same value as ?    For each of the values , determine whether or not exists. In particular, based on the given graph, ask yourself if it is reasonable to say that has a tangent line at for each of the given -values. If so, visually estimate the slope of the tangent line to find the value of .      The graph of .       Having a limit at a point  In Section , we learned that has limit as approaches provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal to) . If so, we write .  Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit near a point where it fails to have a limit. In Figure , at left we see a function whose graph shows a jump at . If we let approach 1 from the left side, the value of approaches 2, but if we let approach from the right, the value of tends to 3. Because the value of does not approach a single number as gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides, we know that does not have a limit at .  For such cases, we introduce the notion of left and right (or one-sided ) limits. left limit  right limit  limit one-sided     We say that has limit as approaches from the left and write provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to while always having . We call the left-hand limit of as approaches . Similarly, we say is the right-hand limit of as approaches and write provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to while always having .    In the graph of the function in Figure , we see that . Precisely because the left and right limits are not equal, the overall limit of as fails to exist.   Functions and that each fail to have a limit at .    For the function pictured at right in Figure , the function fails to have a limit at for a different reason. While the function does not have a jump in its graph at , it is still not the case that approaches a single value as approaches 1. In particular, due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of to the right of , we say that the right-hand limit of as does not exist, and thus .  To summarize, if either a left- or right-hand limit fails to exist or if the left- and right-hand limits are not equal to each other, the overall limit does not exist.   A function has limit as if and only if .   That is, a function has a limit at if and only if both the left- and right-hand limits at exist and have the same value.  In Preview Activity , the function given in Figure fails to have a limit at only two values: at (where the left- and right-hand limits are 2 and , respectively) and at , where does not exist). Note well that even at values such as and where there are holes in the graph, the limit still exists.    Consider a function that is piecewise-defined according to the formula   Use the given formula to answer the following questions.   Axes for plotting the function in Activity .       For each of the values , compute .    For each of the values , determine and .    For each of the values , determine . If the limit fails to exist, explain why by discussing the left- and right-hand limits at the relevant -value.    For which values of is the following statement true?     On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate, labeled graph of . Be sure to carefully use open circles (○) and filled circles (●) to represent key points on the graph, as dictated by the piecewise formula.          Find the interval in which lies and evaluate the function there.    Remember that for , we only consider values of such that . Find the right formula to use in the piecewise definition for to fit the values you are considering.    Use your work in (c) and compare left- and right-hand limits.    Use your work in (a) and (c).    Note that is piecewise linear.           ; is not defined; ; ; .              does not exist. The values of the limits as for are .     , , and .                ; is not defined; ; (by the rule); .              does not exists because the left-hand limit is while the right-hand limit is . All of the other requested limits exist, as left- and right-hand limits exist and are equal in each case. The respective values of the limits as for are .    For , , and , . At , the limit fails to exist, but . At , the limit is , but is not defined. At , the limit is 3, but .              Being continuous at a point  continuous  Intuitively, a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page. Alternatively, we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it. In Figure we consider three functions that have a limit at , and use them to make the idea of continuity more precise.   Functions , , and that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at .    First consider the function in the left-most graph. Note that is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of at . We will naturally say that is not continuous at . For the function , we observe that while , the value of , and thus the limit does not equal the function value. Here, too, we will say that is not continuous , even though the function is defined at . Finally, the function appears to be the most well-behaved of all three, since at its limit and its function value agree. That is, .  With no hole or jump in the graph of at , we say that is continuous there. More formally, we make the following definition.    A function is continuous at  continuous at provided that    has a limit as ,     is defined at , and     .       Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. The definition says that a function is continuous at provided that its limit as exists and equals its function value at . If a function is continuous at every point in an interval , we say the function is continuous on . If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is continuous. Thus, continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.  For example, consider . It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number, and thus if we would like to know , we simply compute .  This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous. Besides polynomial functions, all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point, as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.    This activity builds on your work in Preview Activity , using the same function as given by the graph that is repeated in Figure . Assume that .   The graph of for Activity .       At which values of does not exist?    At which values of is not defined?    At which values of does have a limit, but ?    State all values of for which is not continuous at .    Which condition is stronger, and hence implies the other: has a limit at or is continuous at ? Explain, and hence complete the following sentence: If  at , then  at , where you complete the blanks with has a limit and is continuous , using each phrase once.          Consider the left- and right-hand limits at each value.    Carefully examine places on the graph where there's an open circle.    Are there locations on the graph where the function has a limit but there's a hole in the graph?    Remember that at least one of three conditions must fail: if the function lacks a limit, if the function is undefined, or if the limit exists but does not equal the function value, then is not continuous at the point.    Note that the definition of being continuous requires the limit to exist.           ; .     .     ; .     ; ; ; .     If  is continuous at , then  has a limit at .            does not exist at since and does not exist at since does not exist due to the infinitely oscillatory behavior of .    The only point at which is not defined is at .    At , note that exists (and appears to have value approximately ), but , and thus . At , , but is not defined, so the limit exists but does not equal the function value.    Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), is not continuous at and because does not have a limit at those points; is not continuous at since is not defined there; and is not continuous at because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.     If  is continuous at , then  has a limit at , since one of the defining properties of being continuous at is that the function has a limit at that input value. This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.         Being differentiable at a point  differentiable  We recall that a function is said to be differentiable at if exists. Moreover, for to exist, we know that the function must have a tangent line at the point , since is precisely the slope of this line. In order to even ask if has a tangent line at , it is necessary that be continuous at : if fails to have a limit at , if is not defined, or if does not equal the value of , then it doesn't make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.  Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function is differentiable at , then it must be continuous at . So, if is not continuous at , then it is automatically the case that is not differentiable there. For example, in Figure , both and fail to be differentiable at because neither function is continuous at . But can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous?  In Figure , the function has a sharp corner at a point. For the pictured function , we observe that is clearly continuous at , since .   A function that is continuous at but not differentiable at ; at right, we zoom in on the point in a magnified version of the box in the left-hand plot.    But the function in Figure is not differentiable at because fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that for every value of that is less than 1, while for every value of that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either or would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at . Alternately, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute , and discover that the derivative does not exist. Finally, we can see visually that the function in Figure does not have a tangent line. When we zoom in on on the graph of , no matter how closely we examine the function, it will always look like a V , and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.  If a function does have a tangent line at a given point, when we zoom in on the point of tangency, the function and the tangent line should appear essentially indistinguishable See, for instance, this applet , where zooming in shows the increasing similarity between the tangent line and the curve. . Conversely, if we zoom in on a point and the function looks like a single straight line, then the function should have a tangent line there, and thus be differentiable. Hence, a function that is differentiable at will, up close, look more and more like its tangent line at . Therefore, we say that a function that is differentiable at is locally linear . locally linear   To summarize the preceding discussion of differentiability and continuity, we make several important observations.      If is differentiable at , then is continuous at . Equivalently, if fails to be continuous at , then will not be differentiable at .    A function can be continuous at a point, but not be differentiable there. In particular, a function is not differentiable at if the graph has a sharp corner (or cusp ) cusp at the point .    If is differentiable at , then is locally linear at . That is, when a function is differentiable, it looks linear when viewed up close because it resembles its tangent line there.        In this activity, we explore two different functions and classify the points at which each is not differentiable. Let be the function given by the rule , and let be the function that we have previously explored in Preview Activity , whose graph is given again in Figure .   The graph of for Activity .       Reasoning visually, explain why is differentiable at every point such that .    Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that .    Explain why fails to exist by using small positive and negative values of .    State all values of for which is not differentiable at . For each, provide a reason for your conclusion.    True or false: if a function is differentiable at , then must exist. Why?          What type of function is for all ? For all ?    Recall that .    What is the value of when ?    You might start by identifying points where is not continuous.    What does being differentiable at a point tell you about continuity there?           is piecewise linear.          , but .     .    True.          We know that is given by the formula when and by when . Each of these pieces of is a straight line, so at every point other than the point where they meet, the function has a well-defined slope, and thus is differentiable.    Observe that     Following up on our work in (b), note that whenever , , and thus , while whenever , , and thus Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal, it follows that does not exist.     is not differentiable at because at each of these points is not continuous. In addition, is not differentiable at and because the graph of has a corner point (or cusp) at each of these values.    True: if a function is differentiable at , then must exist. This is true because we know that if is differentiable at a point, then is continuous there, and anytime a function is continuous at a point, it must have a limit there.         Summary     A function has limit as if and only if has a left-hand limit at , has a right-hand limit at , and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at , but the function must approach the same single value from either side of .    A function is continuous at whenever is defined, has a limit as , and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of at .    A function is differentiable at whenever exists, which means that has a tangent line at and thus is locally linear at . Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at and that there is not a corner point or cusp at .    Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at , being continuous at , and being differentiable at ), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if is differentiable at , then is also continuous at , and if is continuous at , then has a limit at .       Limit values of a piecewise graph   Use the figure below, which gives a graph of the function , to give values for the indicated limits. If a limit does not exist, enter none .   (a)  =  help (limits)  (b)  =  (c)  =  (d)  =                       (a) As approaches from either side, the values of get closer and closer to , so the limit appears to be about . (b) As approaches 0 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to . (Recall that to find a limit, we are interested in what happens to the function near but not at .) The limit appears to be about . (c) As approaches 1 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to on one side of and get closer and closer to on the other side of . Thus the limit does not exist. (d) As approaches 4 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to 17. (Again, recall that we don't care what happens right at .) The limit appears to be about 17.      Limit values of a piecewise formula   For the function use algebra to find each of the following limits:        (For each, enter DNE if the limit does not exist.)  Sketch a graph of to confirm your answers.                  is shown below. From this, and from the given formula for , we can see that , and . These are the same value, so we know that the limit must exist: . Note, however, that is not continuous at since .      Continuity and differentiability of a graph   Consider the function graphed below.   At what -values does the function appear to not be continuous?   At what -values does the function appear to not be differentiable?   (Enter none if there are no -values that apply; enter -values as a comma-separated list, e.g., 1,3,5 .)             -values shown. The function appears to be non-differentiable at the -values . (Recall that a function is non-differentiable where it has breaks, sharp corners or vertical tangents.)      Continuity of a piecewise formula   Find so that the following function is continuous:          , the function is continuous at every point except . We choose to make the function continuous at . Since takes the value at , we choose so that goes through the point . Thus .         Consider the graph of the function that is provided in Figure . Assume that each portion of the graph of is a straight line, as pictured.   At left, the piecewise linear function . At right, axes for plotting .       State all values of for which does not exist.    State all values of for which is not continuous at .    State all values of for which is not differentiable at .    On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate graph of .          .     .     .              The only value of at which does not exist is . This is because .     is not continuous at because does not exist. In addition, is not continuous at because is not defined.     is not differentiable at and at since is not continuous at these points. In addition, is not differentiable at since has corner points at these values, making not have a tangent line at these values.    Note that is piecewise linear, so the value of the derivative of (where it exists) is the slope of , which will be constant on each interval where is linear. In addition, note that is not defined at , which is reflected by open circles in the following plot.          For each of the following prompts, give an example of a function that satisfies the stated criteria. A formula or a graph, with reasoning, is sufficient for each. If no such example is possible, explain why.   A function that is continuous at but not differentiable at .    A function that is differentiable at but does not have a limit at .    A function that has a limit at , is defined at , but is not continuous at .    A function that satisfies all of the following:    and      and      and does not exist             .    Impossible.    Let be the function defined to be for every value of , and such that .              The function is continuous at , because , but not differentiable at because has a corner point at .    This is impossible. Any function that is differentiable at a point must have a limit at the point.    Let be the function defined to be for every value of , and such that . This function has a limit of as , but since , the function is not continus at .    A possible function that has the desired properties is shown in the following figure.          Let be a function whose derivative is given by the graph on the right in Figure .   Based on the graph of , what can you say about the behavior of the function ?    At which values of is not defined? What behavior does this lead you to expect to see in the graph of ?    Is it possible for to have points where is not continuous? Explain your answer.    On the axes provided at left, sketch at least two distinct graphs that are possible functions that each have a derivative that matches the provided graph at right. Explain why there are multiple possibilities for .      Axes for plotting and, at right, the graph of .         must be piecewise linear with slope of or , depending on the interval.     is not defined for .    It is possible that is not continuous at .    Two of the many possible graphs for are shown in the following figure.            The function must be piecewise linear since its derivative is piecewise constant. That is, wherever is constant, must be linear. In particular, must be piecewise linear with slope of or , depending on the interval.     is not defined for , as reflected by the open circles on the graph of .    It is possible that is not continuous at , since is not differentiable at these points; everywhere else, must be continuous.    There are many different possible graphs for . Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given . Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative .          Consider the function .   Use a graph to explain visually why is not differentiable at .    Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that .    Investigate the value of by estimating the limit in (b) using small positive and negative values of . For instance, you might compute . Be sure to use several different values of (both positive and negative), including ones closer to 0 than 0.01. What do your results tell you about ?    Use your graph in (a) to sketch an approximate graph of .         At .                                  does not exist.              As seen at left in the figure below in part (d), has a sharp corner point at , which makes not differentiable at this point.  By definition, we know     In the following table, we record the values of for small values of .                            These results show from a different perspective that does not exist. For small negative values, the difference quotient is negative and getting more negative without bound. For small positive values of , the difference quotient is positive and increasing without bound. This shows that does not exist.    An approximate graph of is shown at right in the figure below.          "

  "title": "The Tangent Line Approximation",
  "body": " The Tangent Line Approximation     What is the formula for the general tangent line approximation to a differentiable function at the point ?    What is the principle of local linearity and what is the local linearization of a differentiable function at a point ?    How does knowing just the tangent line approximation tell us information about the behavior of the original function itself near the point of approximation? How does knowing the second derivative's value at this point provide us additional knowledge of the original function's behavior?      Among all functions, linear functions are simplest. One of the powerful consequences of a function being differentiable at a point is that, up close, the function is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point. In certain circumstances, this allows us to approximate the original function with a simpler function that is linear: this can be advantageous when we have limited information about or when is computationally or algebraically complicated. We will explore all of these situations in what follows.  It is essential to recall that when is differentiable at , the value of provides the slope of the tangent line to at the point . If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form Recall that a line with slope that passes through has equation , and this is the point-slope form of the equation. .   Consider the function .     Use the limit definition of the derivative to compute a formula for .    Determine the slope of the tangent line to at the value .    Compute .    Find an equation for the tangent line to at the point . Write your result in point-slope form.    On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate, labeled graph of along with its tangent line at the point .      Axes for plotting and its tangent line to the point .       The tangent line  tangent line equation  Given a function that is differentiable at , we know that we can determine the slope of the tangent line to at by computing . The equation of the resulting tangent line is given in point-slope form by . Note well: there is a major difference between and in this context. The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of , while the latter is the general expression for the rule that defines the function. The same is true for and : we must carefully distinguish between these expressions. Each time we find the tangent line, we need to evaluate the function and its derivative at a fixed -value.  In Figure , we see the graph of a function and its tangent line at the point . Notice how when we zoom in we see the local linearity of more clearly highlighted. The function and its tangent line are nearly indistinguishable up close. Local linearity can also be seen dynamically in this applet .   A function and its tangent line at the point : at left, from a distance, and at right, up close. At right, we label the tangent line function by and observe that for near , .      The local linearization  local linearization  A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates near . By solving for , we can write the equation for the tangent line as This line is itself a function of . Replacing the variable with the expression , we call the local linearization of at the point . In this notation, is nothing more than a new name for the tangent line. As we saw above, for close to , .    Suppose that a function has its tangent line approximation given by at the point , but we do not know anything else about the function . To estimate a value of for near 1, such as , we can use the fact that and hence .    We emphasize that is simply a new name for the tangent line function. Using this new notation and our observation that for near , it follows that we can write .

Axes for plotting and .         Follow the rule for .    Recall that the form of the local linearization is .    Is the function increasing or decreasing at ?    Remember that .    What does the second derivative tell you about the shape of a curve?    Use your work above.           ; .     ; .    Less.     .    Concave up.    The illustration below shows a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through .             Using the formula for , ; Since , we see .    Since , we see and . Alternatively, we could observe that the value and slope of must match the value and slope of at the point of tangency.    Because , we see that is increasing near , and therefore is expected to be less than .    Observe that .    Since , we know is concave up at .    In the figure below, we use the results of our previous work to generate the plot shown, which is a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through .          From Activity , we see that the local linearization is a linear function that shares two important values with the function that it is derived from. In particular,  because , it follows that ; and  because is a linear function, its derivative is its slope.  Hence, for every value of , and specifically . Therefore, we see that is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function at the point .  Thus, if we know the linear approximation for a function, we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency. What remains unknown, however, is the shape of the function at the point of tangency. There are essentially four possibilities, as shown in Figure .   Four possible graphs for a nonlinear differentiable function and how it can be situated relative to its tangent line at a point.    These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative: either , , or .  If , then we know the graph of is concave up, and we see the first possibility on the left, where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.  If , then is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve, as shown in the second figure.  If and changes sign at , the concavity of the graph will change, and we will see either the third or fourth figure. It is possible that but does not change sign at , in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options. .  A fifth option (which is not very interesting) can occur if the function itself is linear, so that for all values of .    The plots in Figure highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency: whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself. This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large or too small in comparison to the true value of . For instance, in the first situation in the leftmost plot in Figure where , because the tangent line falls below the curve, we know that for all values of near .    This activity concerns a function about which the following information is known:    is a differentiable function defined at every real number           has its graph given in Figure       At center, a graph of ; at left, axes for plotting ; at right, axes for plotting .    Your task is to determine as much information as possible about (especially near the value ) by responding to the questions below.

The graph of is the derivative of the graph of .    Is increasing, decreasing, or neither when ?    Draw first. Then think about options for relative to the graph of .    Does the tangent line lie above or below the graph of at ?           .     .    See the image in part .    Neither.    See the image below, which shows, at left, a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through .        Too large.          Since and , we have .    Using our work in (a), .    See the image in part .    The slope of the tangent line to is increasing for because is an increasing function on this interval. Similarly, for , the slope of the tangent line to is decreasing. Right at , the slope of the tangent line to is neither increasing nor decreasing.    See the plot in the image below, which shows, at left, a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through . Note that is concave up for since is increasing on that interval, and is concave down for since is decreasing there. Hence changes from concave up to concave down right at , which is also the point near 2 where the graph of is steepest.        Because the tangent line to lies above the graph of to the right of , our estimate of is too large the local linearization overshoots the true value of at this point.       The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that finds wide application in calculus. For example, by approximating a function with its local linearization, it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function. Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits. For instance, we have seen that the limit is indeterminate, because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0. While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify , it is straightforward to show that the linearization of at the point is given by . Hence, for values of near 0, , and therefore , which makes plausible the fact that .    Summary     The tangent line to a differentiable function at the point is given in point-slope form by the equation .    The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function is differentiable, the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line. That is, a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close. We rename the tangent line to be the function , where . Thus, for all near .    If we know the tangent line approximation to a function , then because and , we also know the values of both the function and its derivative at the point where . In other words, the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function. If, in addition, we know the value of , we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of , depending on the concavity of .         Approximating   Use linear approximation to approximate as follows.  Let . The equation of the tangent line to at can be written in the form . Compute and .      Using this find the approximation for .  Answer:                        Local linearization of a graph   The figure below shows and its local linearization at , .

(a) As the cup of coffee cools, the temperature decreases, so is negative. (b) Since , the units are degrees Celsius per minute (degC\/min). The quantity represents the rate at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, 30 minutes after the cup is put on the counter. Thus we can complete the statement: At 30 minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its temperature is 51 degC and will decrease by about 1.125 degC in the next 75 seconds.

Since for , we know that is concave down for . This means to the left of the point of tangency at , the tangent line lies above the curve, and thus the estimate in (b) is too large.    In the following figure, we see a possible function that matches the value and slope of the tangent line at the point and that is concave down to the left of and concave up to the right.          A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes.

This implies that near , the graph of (the tangent line to at lies above the graph of . Therefore, the approximation given in part (c) is probably an overestimate.       An object moving along a straight line path has a differentiable position function ; measures the object's position relative to the origin at time . It is known that at time seconds, the object's position is feet (i.e., 4 feet to the right of the origin). Furthermore, the object's instantaneous velocity at is feet per second, and its acceleration at the same instant is feet per second per second.   Use local linearity to estimate the position of the object at .    Is your estimate likely too large or too small? Why?    In everyday language, describe the behavior of the moving object at .

One use of the linearization is that for close to , can provide a good approximation to . So .    Since is positive, we know that the graph of is concave up at . This means that the linearization of at lies below the graph of and so is an underestimate to .    Given that is negative, the object is moving back toward its original position. The fact that is positive means that the velocity of the object is increasing at . This means that the object is actually slowing down as it moves toward toward its starting position at .

What is the derivative of a power function of the form ? What is the derivative of an exponential function of form ?    If we know the derivative of , what is the derivative of , where is a constant?    If we know the derivatives of and , how do we compute the derivative of ?      In Chapter , we developed the concept of the derivative of a function. We now know that the derivative of a function measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to . The derivative also tells us the slope of the tangent line to at any given value of . So far, we have focused on interpreting the derivative graphically or, in the context of a physical setting, as a meaningful rate of change. To calculate the value of the derivative at a specific point, we have relied on the limit definition of the derivative, .  In this chapter, we investigate how the limit definition of the derivative leads to interesting patterns and rules that enable us to find a formula for quickly, without using the limit definition directly. For example, we would like to apply shortcuts to differentiate a function such as    Functions of the form , where , are often called power functions . The first two questions below revisit work we did earlier in Chapter , and the following questions extend those ideas to higher powers of .   Use the limit definition of the derivative to find for .    Use the limit definition of the derivative to find for .    Use the limit definition of the derivative to find for . (Hint: . Apply this rule to within the limit definition.)    Based on your work in (a), (b), and (c), what do you conjecture is the derivative of ? Of ?    Conjecture a formula for the derivative of that holds for any positive integer . That is, given where is a positive integer, what do you think is the formula for ?        Some Key Notation  In addition to our usual notation, there are other ways to denote the derivative of a function, as well as the instruction to take the derivative. If we are thinking about the relationship between and , we sometimes denote the derivative of with respect to by the symbol which we read dee-y dee-x. For example, if , we'll write that the derivative is . This notation comes from the fact that the derivative is related to the slope of a line, and slope is measured by . Note that while we read as change in over change in , we view as a single symbol, not a quotient of two quantities.  We use a variant of this notation as the instruction to take the derivative. In particular, means take the derivative of the quantity in with respect to . For example, we may write .  It is important to note that the independent variable can be different from . If we have , we then write . Similarly, if , we say . And it is also true that . This notation may also be used for second derivatives: .  In what follows, we'll build a repertoire of functions for which we can quickly compute the derivative.    Constant, Power, and Exponential Functions  So far, we know the derivative formula for two important classes of functions: constant functions and power functions. If is a constant function, its graph is a horizontal line with slope zero at every point. Thus, . We summarize this with the following rule.   Constant Functions   derivative constant function For any real number , if , then .     If , then . Similarly, .    In your work in Preview Activity , you conjectured that for any positive integer , if , then . This rule can be formally proved for any positive integer , and also for any nonzero real number (positive or negative).   Power Functions   derivative power function For any nonzero real number , if , then .     Using the rule for power functions, we can compute the following derivatives. If , then . Similarly, if , then , and .    It will be instructive to have a derivative formula for one more type of basic function. For now, we simply state this rule without explanation or justification; we will explore why this rule is true in one of the exercises. And we will encounter graphical reasoning for why the rule is plausible in Preview Activity .   Exponential Functions   derivative exponential function For any positive real number , if , then .     If , then . Similarly, for , . It is especially important to note that when , where is the base of the natural logarithm function, we have that since . This is an extremely important property of the function : its derivative function is itself!    Note carefully the distinction between power functions and exponential functions: in power functions, the variable is in the base, as in , while in exponential functions, the variable is in the power, as in . As we can see from the rules, this makes a big difference in the form of the derivative.    Use the three rules above to determine the derivative of each of the following functions. For each, state your answer using full and proper notation, labeling the derivative with its name. For example, if you are given a function , you should write or as part of your response.                                            Is a variable or a constant?    Is a power or exponential function?    Is a power or exponential function?    Is a constant or a variable?     is a constant    Remember the notation here means take the derivative with respect to of .     Rewrite the fraction using a negative exponent.           .     .     .     .     .     .     .           is constant, so .     is an exponential function, so .     is a power function, thus .     is constant, and therefore .     is exponential (since is a constant), and so we have .     , by the rule for power functions.     , so .         Constant Multiples and Sums of Functions  Next we will learn how to compute the derivative of a function constructed as an algebraic combination of basic functions. For instance, we'd like to be able to take the derivative of a polynomial function such as , which is a sum of constant multiples of powers of . To that end, we develop two new rules: the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule.  How is the derivative of related to the derivative of ? Recall that when we multiply a function by a constant , we vertically stretch the graph by a factor of (and reflect the graph across if ). This vertical stretch affects the slope of the graph, so the slope of the function is times as steep as the slope of . Thus, when we multiply a function by a factor of , we change the value of its derivative by a factor of as well. The Constant Multiple Rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits, using the limit definition of the derivative. ,   The Constant Multiple Rule   constant multiple rule For any real number , if is a differentiable function with derivative , then .   In words, this rule says that the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.     If , we have . Similarly, .    Next we examine a sum of two functions. If we have and , we can compute a new function by adding the outputs of the two functions: . Not only is the value of the new function the sum of the values of the two known functions, but the slope of the new function is the sum of the slopes of the known functions. Therefore Like the Constant Multiple Rule, the Sum Rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits, using the limit definition of the derivative. , we arrive at the following Sum Rule for derivatives:   The Sum Rule   sum rule If and are differentiable functions with derivatives and respectively, then .   In words, the Sum Rule tells us that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. It also tells us that a sum of two differentiable functions is also differentiable. Furthermore, because we can view the difference function as , the Sum Rule and Constant Multiple Rules together tell us that , or that the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives. We can now compute derivatives of sums and differences of elementary functions.    Using the sum rule, . Using both the sum and constant multiple rules, if , then .      Use only the rules for constant, power, and exponential functions, together with the Constant Multiple and Sum Rules, to compute the derivative of each function below with respect to the given independent variable. Note well that we do not yet know any rules for how to differentiate the product or quotient of functions. This means that you may have to do some algebra first on the functions below before you can actually use existing rules to compute the desired derivative formula. In each case, label the derivative you calculate with its name using proper notation such as , , , etc.                                            Use the sum rule.    Use the sum rule together with the constant multiple rule.    How can you rewrite using exponents?    Is a constant or variable?    Expand the product before attempting to find the derivative.    Rewrite the single fraction as a sum of three fractions, and simplify.    Note that is the independent variable.           .     .     .     .     .     .     .           , so by the sum rule, .     , so by the sum and constant multiple rules, .     , thus .    Since and , , and are all constants, it follows from the sum and constant multiple rules, as well as the derivative of a constant rule, that . (Note particularly that since is constant.     , thus .     . Now it follows that .     , so .       In the same way that we have shortcut rules to help us find derivatives, we introduce some language that is simpler and shorter. Often, rather than say take the derivative of , we'll instead say simply differentiate . Similarly, if the derivative exists at a point, we say is differentiable at that point, or that can be differentiated.  As we work with the algebraic structure of functions, it is important to develop a big picture view of what we are doing. Here, we make several general observations based on the rules we have so far.  The derivative of any polynomial function will be another polynomial function, and that the degree of the derivative is one less than the degree of the original function. For instance, if , is a degree 5 polynomial, and its derivative, , is a degree 4 polynomial.  The derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function: for example, if , then , which is also exponential.  We should not lose sight of the fact that all of the meaning of the derivative that we developed in Chapter still holds. The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the original function, as well as the slope of the tangent line at any selected point on the curve.      Each of the following questions asks you to use derivatives to answer key questions about functions. Be sure to think carefully about each question and to use proper notation in your responses.     Find the slope of the tangent line to at the point where .    A population of cells is growing in such a way that its total number in millions is given by the function , where is measured in days.     Determine the instantaneous rate at which the population is growing on day 4, and include units on your answer.    Is the population growing at an increasing rate or growing at a decreasing rate on day 4? Explain.       Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve at the point where .    What is the difference between being asked to find the slope of the tangent line (asked in (a)) and the equation of the tangent line (asked in (c))?          How would help you answer the question?    Think about finding both and .    What two important pieces of information do you need to know to determine the equation of a line?    What information do you find in both (a) and (c)?           .    (i.) million cells per day; (ii.) the population is growing at an increasing rate.     .    The slope is a number, while the equation is, well, an equation.          Note that since , we have . Thus, . Thus, the slope of the tangent line to at the point where is .    For (i.), note that , and therefore million cells per day. For (ii.), we can compute and find that and therefore find that . Since is positive, this tells us that the instantaneous rate of change is increasing at , and thus the population is growing at an increasing rate.    Given , first observe that , so the tangent line will pass through . Further, since , we have , which is the slope of the tangent line. The equation of the tangent line is therefore .    The biggest difference is that (a) asks for the slope of the tangent line, while (c) asks for the equation of the tangent line. The latter requires the slope of the tangent line, but the slope and equation are two different entities.         Summary     Given a differentiable function , we can express the derivative of in several different notations: , , , and .    The limit definition of the derivative leads to patterns among certain families of functions that enable us to compute derivative formulas without resorting directly to the limit definition. For example, if is a power function of the form , then for any real number other than 0. This is called the Rule for Power Functions.    We have stated a rule for derivatives of exponential functions in the same spirit as the rule for power functions: for any positive real number , if , then .    If we are given a constant multiple of a function whose derivative we know, or a sum of functions whose derivatives we know, the Constant Multiple and Sum Rules make it straightforward to compute the derivative of the overall function. More formally, if and are differentiable with derivatives and and and are constants, then .       Derivative of a power function   Find the derivative of .                Derivative of a rational function   Find the derivative of .          , so       Derivative of a root function   Find the derivative of  .          , we have       Derivative of a quadratic   Find the derivative of .          .      Derivative of a sum of power functions   Find the derivative of .          and . Thus       Simplifying a product before differentiating   Find the derivative of .          through the second term in the expression, . Thus       Simplifying a quotient before differentiating   Find the derivative of .          ,       Finding a tangent line equation   Find an equation for the line tangent to the graph of at , where is given by .          , so . Thus the equation of the tangent line is , or .      Determining where   If , find analytically all values of for which . (Enter your answer as a comma separated list of numbers, e.g., -1,0,2)          , we have This is zero if or .       Let and be differentiable functions for which the following information is known: , , , .   Let be the new function defined by the rule . Determine and .

Since , it follows that by the sum and constant multiple rules. Using the given function and derivative values for and at , we see that and . Since , we conclude that is increasing at .    First, the linearization of at is . Using the linearization to estimate , we find that .       Let functions and be the piecewise linear functions given by their respective graphs in Figure . Use the graphs to answer the following questions.   The graphs of (in blue) and (in green).       At what values of is not differentiable? At what values of is not differentiable? Why?    Let . At what values of is not differentiable? Why?    Determine and .    Find an equation for the tangent line to at the point .          is not differentiable at and ; is not differentiable at and .     is not differentiable at and .     ; .     .         The function is differentiable at points where its graph is locally linear or smooth. Since there are sharp corners in the graph of at and , we see that is not differentiable at those points. Similarly, the sharp corners in at and mean that is not differentiable at these points, either.    In order for to be differentiable at a point, both and must be differentiable at the point. So is not differentiable at and .    Using the sum and scalar multiple rules, we have . The slope of at is and the slope of at is , so and . It follows that . Similarly, the slope of at is and the slope of at is , so and . It follows that .    Note that and . Thus, the line tangent to the graph of at is .       Consider the functions and , for which you are given the facts that and . Do not be concerned with where these derivative formulas come from. We restrict our interest in both functions to the domain .   Let . Determine .    Find an equation for the tangent line to at the point .    Let . Is increasing or decreasing at the instant ? Why?          .     .     is decreasing at .         We note that has the structure , so by the sum and constant multiple rules, . Applying the given information about and , .    We see that . Similarly, . Using these values, we find that the tangent line to at the point is .    To determine whether is increasing or decreasing at , we compute . First, . Hence, . Since is negative, is decreasing at .       Let . The goal of this problem is to explore how the value of affects the derivative of , without assuming we know the rule for that we have stated and used in earlier work in this section.   Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that .    Explain why it is also true that .    Use computing technology and small values of to estimate the value of when . Do likewise when .    Note that it would be ideal if the value of the limit was , for then would be a particularly special function: its derivative would be simply , which would mean that its derivative is itself. By experimenting with different values of between and , try to find a value for for which .    Compute and . What does your work in (b) and (c) suggest is true about and ?    How do your investigations in (d) lead to a particularly important fact about the function ?          ,    Since does not depend at all on , we may treat as constant in the noted limit and thus write the value in front of the limit being taken.    When , ; when , .     (for which )     and      .         By definition, . Using the fact that along with , we have , where the last equality follows by removing the common factor of from each term in the numerator.    Since does not depend at all on , we may treat as constant in the noted limit. Thus, . Note that this tells us that the derivative of is some constant multiple of (and that the constant's values must be .)    Using , it appears that when , , while when , .    By experimenting, we see first that (for which , so needs to be slightly bigger than ). Continuing to try values of that result in being closer and closer to , we find (for which )    We note that and . Since these values correspond to the values of when and , we conjecture that and     Our work suggests that , and when , it follows that Thus, is a very special function: its derivative is itself!

The sine and cosine functions  The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics. Sometimes called the circular functions due to their definition on the unit circle, these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as tidal elevations, the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring, or the location of a point on a bicycle tire. Like polynomial and exponential functions, the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions, ones that are often used in building more complicated functions. As such, we would like to know formulas for and , and the next two activities lead us to that end.    Consider the function , which is graphed in Figure below.

The following rules summarize the results of the activities These two rules may be formally proved using the limit definition of the derivative and the expansion identities for and . .   Sine and Cosine Functions   derivative cosine  derivative sine For all real numbers , .   We have now added the sine and cosine functions to our library of basic functions whose derivatives we know. The constant multiple and sum rules still hold, of course, as well as all of the inherent meaning of the derivative.    Answer each of the following questions. Where a derivative is requested, be sure to label the derivative function with its name using proper notation.   Determine the derivative of .    Find the exact slope of the tangent line to at the point where .    Find the equation of the tangent line to at the point where .    Determine the derivative of .    The function represents a population of a particular kind of animal that lives on a small island, where is measured in hundreds and is measured in decades since January 1, 2010. What is the instantaneous rate of change of on January 1, 2030? What are the units of this quantity? Write a sentence in everyday language that explains how the population is behaving at this point in time.          Recall the constant multiple and sum rules.     tells us the slope of the tangent line at .

The tangent line passes through the point with slope . We observe first that . Next, we compute the derivative function, , and find that . Thus, . Hence the equation of the tangent line (in point-slope form) is given by .    Noting that is a constant, we have .    The value of will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of at the instant two decades have elapsed. Observe that , and thus hundred animals per decade. This tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of on January 1, 2030 is about animals per decade, which tells us that the animal population is shrinking considerably at this point in time. We might say that for whatever the population is on January 1, 2030, we expect that population to drop by about 3300 animals over the next ten years, provided the current population trend continues.         Summary     For an exponential function  , the graph of appears to be a scaled version of the original function. In particular, careful analysis of the graph of , suggests that , which is a special case of the rule we stated in Section .    By carefully analyzing the graphs of and , and by using the limit definition of the derivative at select points, we found that and .    We note that all previously encountered derivative rules still hold, but now may also be applied to functions involving the sine and cosine. All of the established meaning of the derivative applies to these trigonometric functions as well.       Exercises   Suppose that represents the value of a person's investment portfolio in thousands of dollars in year , where corresponds to January 1, 2010.   At what instantaneous rate is the portfolio's value changing on January 1, 2012? Include units on your answer.    Determine the value of . What are the units on this quantity and what does it tell you about how the portfolio's value is changing?    On the interval , graph the function and describe its behavior in the context of the problem. Then, compare the graphs of the functions and , as well as the graphs of their derivatives and . What is the impact of the term on the behavior of the function ?          thousands of dollars per year.     thousands of dollars per year per year. At this moment, is decreasing and we expect the derivative's value to decrease by about thousand dollars per year over the course of the next year.    See the figure below. Adding the term to to create the function adds volatility to the value of the portfolio.            January 1, 2012 corresponds to the instant , so we compute . First, we observe by the sum and constant multiple rules that . Thus, . Since is measured in thousands of dollars and in years, we know that the portfolio's value is decreasing at a rate of dollars per year on January 1, 2012.    Since , it follows that , and thus , with units ``thousands of dollars per year per year.'' This means that at the moment , the portfolio's value is decreasing at a decreasing rate. More specifically, we know that is decreasing at the moment and expect the derivative's value to decrease by about thousand dollars per year over the course of the next year. In other words, the portfolio's value is not only decreasing, but we expect it to decrease more rapidly as the year goes on.    In the figure below, we see plots of both and along with their corresponding derivatives. We see that the function is a purely exponential function that always increases at an increasing rate. By adding the term to to create the function , we add volatility to the value of the portfolio: the oscillating nature of the sine function not only creates variance in the stock's value, but also in its rate of change. We also observe that as time progresses and the value of increases, the effect of lessens.          Let .   Determine the exact slope of the tangent line to at the point where .    Determine the tangent line approximation to at the point where .    At the point where , is increasing, decreasing, or neither?

The slope of the line tangent to the graph of at is given by . To find we first find , which is . Thus, .    The linearization to at is L. We calculated in part (a) and so . We also have . Hence .    A differentiable function is increasing at if and only if and decreasing if and only if . Now , so is decreasing at .    If a curve defined by a function is concave up at , then the tangent line to at lies below the curve and if the graph of is concave down at , then the tangent line to at lies above the curve. The concavity of a curve is determined by the second derivative and . Since , the graph of is concave down at and the tangent line to lies above the curve at this point.       In this exercise, we explore how the limit definition of the derivative more formally shows that . Letting , note that the limit definition of the derivative tells us that .

How do we compute the derivative of a product of two basic functions in terms of the derivatives of the basic functions?    How do we compute the derivative of a quotient of two basic functions in terms of the derivatives of the basic functions?    How do the product and quotient rules combine with the sum and constant multiple rules to expand the library of functions we can differentiate quickly?      So far, we can differentiate power functions ( ), exponential functions ( ), and the two fundamental trigonometric functions ( and ). With the sum rule and constant multiple rules, we can also compute the derivative of combined functions.    Differentiate Because is a sum of basic functions, we can now quickly say that .    What about a product or quotient of two basic functions, such as , or ?  While the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, it turns out that the rules for computing derivatives of products and quotients are more complicated.   Let and be the functions defined by and .   Determine and .    Let and observe that . Rewrite the formula for by distributing the term. Then, compute using the sum and constant multiple rules.    True or false: .    Let and observe that . Rewrite the formula for by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator and simplify to write as a sum of constant multiples of powers of . Then, compute using the sum and constant multiple rules.    True or false: .        The product rule  As part (b) of Preview Activity shows, it is not true in general that the derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the derivatives of those functions. To see why this is the case, we consider an example involving meaningful functions.  Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company. Let represent the number of shares owned on day , where represents the first day on which shares were purchased. Let give the value of one share of the stock on day ; note that the units on are dollars per share. To compute the total value of the stock on day , we take the product . Observe that over time, both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary. The derivative measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing, while measures the rate at which the value per share is changing. How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?  To help us understand the relationship among changes in , , and , let's consider some specific data.  Suppose that on day 100, the investor owns 520 shares of stock and the stock's current value is $27.50 per share. This tells us that and .  On day 100, the investor purchases an additional 12 shares (so the number of shares held is rising at a rate of 12 shares per day).  On that same day the price of the stock is rising at a rate of 0.75 dollars per share per day.    In calculus notation, the latter two facts tell us that (shares per day) and (dollars per share per day). At what rate is the value of the investor's total holdings changing on day 100?  Observe that the increase in total value comes from two sources: the growing number of shares, and the rising value of each share. If only the number of shares is increasing (and the value of each share is constant), the rate at which which total value would rise is the product of the current value of the shares and the rate at which the number of shares is changing. That is, the rate at which total value would change is given by .  Note particularly how the units make sense and show the rate at which the total value is changing, measured in dollars per day.  If instead the number of shares is constant, but the value of each share is rising, the rate at which the total value would rise is the product of the number of shares and the rate of change of share value. The total value is rising at a rate of .  Of course, when both the number of shares and the value of each share are changing, we have to include both of these sources. In that case the rate at which the total value is rising is .  We expect the total value of the investor's holdings to rise by about $720 on the 100th day. While this example highlights why the product rule is true, there are some subtle issues to recognize. For one, if the stock's value really does rise exactly $0.75 on day 100, and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100, then we'd expect that . If, as noted above, we expect the total value to rise by $720, then with , then it seems we should find that . Why do the two results differ by 9? One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that represents an instantaneous rate of change, while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day. The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.  Next, we expand our perspective from the specific example above to the more general and abstract setting of a product of two differentiable functions, and . If , our work above suggests that . Indeed, a formal proof using the limit definition of the derivative can be given to show that the following rule, called the product rule , product rule holds in general.   Product Rule   product rule If and are differentiable functions, then their product is also a differentiable function, and .   In light of the earlier example involving shares of stock, the product rule also makes sense intuitively: the rate of change of should take into account both how fast and are changing, as well as how large and are at the point of interest. In words the product rule says: if is the product of two functions (the first function) and (the second), then the derivative of is the first times the derivative of the second, plus the second times the derivative of the first. It is often a helpful mental exercise to say this phrasing aloud when executing the product rule.    If , we can use the product rule to differentiate . The first function is and the second function is . By the product rule, will be given by the first, , times the derivative of the second, , plus the second, , times the derivative of the first, . That is, .      Use the product rule to answer each of the questions below. Throughout, be sure to carefully label any derivative you find by name. It is not necessary to algebraically simplify any of the derivatives you compute.   Let . Find .    Let . Find .    Determine the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point if is given by the rule .    Find the tangent line approximation to the function at the point if is given by the rule .

By the product rule, .    By the product rule, .    To determine the slope of the tangent line at , we want to find . Since , the product rule tells us that . Thus, .    First, observe that . Further, by the product rule, , and therefore . Therefore, .         The quotient rule  Because quotients and products are closely linked, we can use the product rule to understand how to take the derivative of a quotient. Let be defined by , where and are both differentiable functions. It turns out that is differentiable everywhere that . We would like a formula for in terms of , , , and . Multiplying both sides of the formula by , we observe that .  Now we can use the product rule to differentiate . .  We want to know a formula for , so we solve this equation for . and dividing both sides by , we have .  Finally, we recall that . Substituting this expression in the preceding equation, we have .  This calculation gives us the quotient rule .   Quotient Rule   quotient rule If and are differentiable functions, then their quotient is also a differentiable function for all where and .   As with the product rule, it can be helpful to think of the quotient rule verbally. If a function is the quotient of a top function and a bottom function , then is given by the bottom times the derivative of the top, minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom squared.     If , we call the top function and the bottom function. By the quotient rule, is given by the bottom, , times the derivative of the top, , minus the top, , times the derivative of the bottom, , all over the bottom squared, . That is, .  In this particular example, it is possible to simplify by removing a factor of from both the numerator and denominator, so that .    In general, we must be careful in doing any such simplification, as we don't want to execute the quotient rule correctly but then make an algebra error.    Use the quotient rule to answer each of the questions below. Throughout, be sure to carefully label any derivative you find by name. That is, if you're given a formula for , clearly label the formula you find for . It is not necessary to algebraically simplify any of the derivatives you compute.   Let . Find .    Let . Find .    Determine the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where .    When a camera flashes, the intensity of light seen by the eye is given by the function , where is measured in candles and is measured in milliseconds. Compute , , and ; include appropriate units on each value; and discuss the meaning of each.          When applying the quotient rule, use parentheses around the bottom function, , to ensure that when you compute the bottom times the derivative of the top that the rule is applied correctly.    When applying the quotient rule, use parentheses around the bottom function, , and its derivative to ensure that the rule is applied correctly.    Remember one of the key interpretations of the derivative.    Let the top function be and simply use the constant multiple rule to find its derivative.           .     .     .     , , and , each in candles per millisecond.          By the quotient rule, .    By the quotient rule, .    We first compute . By the quotient rule, . From this, it follows that , which is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where .    By the quotient rule and algebraic simplification, . Thus, , , and , each measured in candles per millisecond. These results show that at , the intensity of the flash is increasing rapidly, while at and , the intensity is decreasing, with the intensity decreasing more rapidly when .         Combining rules  In order to apply the derivative shortcut rules correctly we must recognize the fundamental structure of a function.    Determine the derivative of the function . How do we decide which rules to apply? Our first task is to recognize the structure of the function. This function is a sum of two slightly less complicated functions, so we can apply the sum rule When taking a derivative that involves the use of multiple derivative rules, it is often helpful to use the notation to wait to apply subsequent rules. This is demonstrated in each of the two examples presented here. to get   Now, the left-hand term above is a product, so the product rule is needed there, while the right-hand term is a quotient, so the quotient rule is required. Applying these rules respectively, we find that .      Differentiate . The function is a quotient of two simpler functions, so the quotient rule will be needed. To begin, we set up the quotient rule and use the notation to indicate the derivatives of the numerator and denominator. Thus, . Now, there remain two derivatives to calculate. The first one, calls for use of the product rule, while the second, needs only the sum rule. Applying these rules, we now have . While some simplification is possible, we are content to leave in its current form.    Success in applying derivative rules begins with recognizing the structure of the function, followed by the careful and diligent application of the relevant derivative rules. The best way to become proficient at this process is to do a large number of examples.    Use relevant derivative rules to answer each of the questions below. Throughout, be sure to use proper notation and carefully label any derivative you find by name.   Let . Find .    Let . Find .    Let . Find .    A moving particle has its position in feet at time in seconds given by the function . Find the particle's instantaneous velocity at the moment .    Suppose that and are differentiable functions and it is known that , , , and . If and , calculate and .          Observe that is fundamentally a product. Which is the first function? The second?    Note that has the overall structure of a quotient.    Think about how is a sum of three functions. What is the structure of each of the three functions in the sum?    How is the velocity of a moving object related to its position?    Since we know , it follows .           .     .     .     feet per second.     and .          Using the product rule, followed by the sum and constant multiple rule, observe that     We use the quotient rule on , followed by the product rule to differentiate the denominator, finding that     Using the sum and constant multiple rules, it follows first that . Applying the product rule in the first two terms and the quotient rule in the third, we find that .    The particle's instantaneous velocity at the moment is given by . We use the quotient rule to find , and simplify by removing a common factor of to get . Thus, , which is the particle's instantaneous velocity in feet per second at the moment .    Since , the product rule tells us , and since , by the quotient rule we know . Using the given information ( , , , and ) we now see that and .       As the algebraic complexity of the functions we are able to differentiate continues to increase, it is important to remember that all of the derivative's meaning continues to hold. Regardless of the structure of the function , the value of tells us the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to at the moment , as well as the slope of the tangent line to at the point .    Summary     If a function is a sum, product, or quotient of simpler functions, then we can use the sum, product, or quotient rules to differentiate it in terms of the simpler functions and their derivatives.    The product rule tells us that if is a product of differentiable functions and according to the rule , then .    The quotient rule tells us that if is a quotient of differentiable functions and according to the rule , then .    Along with the constant multiple and sum rules, the product and quotient rules enable us to compute the derivative of any function that consists of sums, constant multiples, products, and quotients of basic functions. For instance, if has the form , then is a quotient, in which the numerator is a sum of constant multiples and the denominator is a product. This, the derivative of can be found by applying the quotient rule and then using the sum and constant multiple rules to differentiate the numerator and the product rule to differentiate the denominator.

With the price of ethanol fuel rising, he decides that it would be prudent to devote more and more of his acreage to producing corn. As he grows more and more corn, he learns efficiencies that increase his yield per acre. In the present year, he used 7000 acres of his land to grow corn, and that land had an average yield of 170 bushels per acre. At the current time, he plans to increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of 600 acres\/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of 8 bushels per acre per year. Use this information to answer the following questions.   Say that the present year is , that denotes the number of acres the farmer devotes to growing corn in year , represents the average yield in year (measured in bushels per acre), and is the total number of bushels of corn the farmer produces. What is the formula for in terms of and ? Why?    What is the value of ? What does it measure?    Write an expression for in terms of , , , and . Explain your thinking.    What is the value of ? What does it measure?    Based on the given information and your work above, estimate the value of .          bushels in year .     bushels of corn.     .     bushels per year.     bushels.         If we multiply acres by bushels per acre, we arrive at bushels as the total number of bushels of corn the farmer produces in year .    We are given that acres with a yield of bushels per acre, giving us bushels. Thus, the farmer produces bushels of corn in the present year.    The product rule tells us that .    We know and . We are also given that the farmer will increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of acres\/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of bushels per acre per year. This tells us that and . So . Note that the units of are acres and the units of are bushels per acre per year. So the units of are bushels per year. Similarly, the units of are acres per year and the units of are bushels per acre, so the units of are also bushels per acre. So the units of are bushels per acre. Therefore, tells us that the number of bushels the farmer can produce will increase by approximately bushels for each year past the present year.    The linearization of at is , bushels.       Let be the gas consumption (in liters\/km) of a car going at velocity (in km\/hour). In other words, tells you how many liters of gas the car uses to go one kilometer if it is traveling at kilometers per hour. In addition, suppose that and .   Let be the distance the same car goes on one liter of gas at velocity . What is the relationship between and ? Hence find and .    Let be the gas consumption in liters per hour of a car going at velocity . In other words, tells you how many liters of gas the car uses in one hour if it is going at velocity . What is the algebraic relationship between and ? Hence find and .    How would you explain the practical meaning of these function and derivative values to a driver who knows no calculus? Include units on each of the function and derivative values you discuss in your response.          kilometers per liter, and . kilometers per liter per kilometer per hour.     liters per hour and liters per hour per kilometer per hour.    Think carefully about units and how each of the three pairs of values expresses fundamentally the same facts.         Observe that the units on are ``kilometers per liter.'' Since the units on are ``liters per kilometer,'' it follows that is the reciprocal of : . By the quotient rule, we then know that . Further, using the given values we can say that kilometers per liter, and . Note that the units on are ``kilometers per liter per kilometer per hour.''    Since the units on are ``liters per hour,'' and the units on are ``liters per kilometer,'' we note that if we multiply by (whose units are ``kilometers per hour''), we get that the units on match the units of . Thus, . By the product rule, it follows that . Using the known function and derivative values of , we determine that liters per hour and liters per hour per kilometer per hour.    To explain the meaning of these function and derivative values to someone who doesn't know calculus, we could say something like the following:   The given values of and tell us that when the car is going kilometers per hour, it is using liters of fuel for every kilometer it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above kph, we expect that the car will use about an additional liters of fuel per kilometer.    The values of and tell us that when the car is going kilometers per hour, it is able to travel kilometers for each liter of fuel used. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above kph, we expect that the car will be able to travel about fewer kilometers per liter of fuel.    Finally, the values of and tell us that when the car is going kilometers per hour, it is using liters of fuel for every hour it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above kph, we expect that the car will ues about more liters of fuel per hour.   Note that all three of these observations are saying fundamentally the same thing, just from different perspectives: the first regards fuel consumption measured in liters per kilometer; the second regards fuel consumption in kilometers per liter; and the last regards fuel consumption in liters per hour.

In the present year, he used 7000 acres of his land to grow corn, and that land had an average yield of 170 bushels per acre.

How do the derivatives of , , , and combine with other derivative rules we have developed to expand the library of functions we can quickly differentiate?      One of the powerful themes in trigonometry trigonometry comes from a very simple idea: locating a point on the unit circle.   The unit circle and the definition of the sine and cosine functions.    Because each angle in standard position corresponds to one and only one point on the unit circle, the - and -coordinates of this point are each functions of . In fact, this is the very definition of and : is the -coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle , and is the -coordinate. From this simple definition, all of trigonometry is founded. For instance, the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity, trigonometry fundamental trigonometric identity  , is a restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem, applied to the right triangle shown in Figure .  There are four other trigonometric functions, each defined in terms of the sine and\/or cosine functions.  The tangent function tangent is defined by ;  the cotangent function is its reciprocal: .  The secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function, ;  and the cosecant function is the reciprocal of the sine function, .  These six trigonometric functions together offer us a wide range of flexibility in problems involving right triangles.  Because we know the derivatives of the sine and cosine function, we can now develop shortcut differentiation rules for the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions. In this section's preview activity, we work through the steps to find the derivative of .   Consider the function , and remember that .   What is the domain of ?

Derivatives of the cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions  cotangent  secant  cosecant  In Preview Activity , we found that the derivative of the tangent function can be expressed in several ways, but most simply in terms of the secant function. Next, we develop the derivative of the cotangent function.  Let . To find , we observe that and apply the quotient rule. Hence   By the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity, we see that , and recalling that , it follows that we can express by the rule .  Note that neither nor is defined when , which occurs at every integer multiple of . Hence we have the following rule.   Cotangent Function   derivative cotangent For all real numbers such that , where , .   Notice that the derivative of the cotangent function is very similar to the derivative of the tangent function we discovered in Preview Activity .

Therefore, and have the same domain: all real numbers such that , where .       Using the quotient rule we have determined the derivatives of the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, expanding our overall library of functions we can differentiate. Observe that just as the derivative of any polynomial function is a polynomial, and the derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function, so it is that the derivative of any basic trigonometric function is another function that consists of basic trigonometric functions. This makes sense because all trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence their derivatives will be periodic, too.  The derivative retains all of its fundamental meaning as an instantaneous rate of change and as the slope of the tangent line to the function under consideration.    Answer each of the following questions. Where a derivative is requested, be sure to label the derivative function with its name using proper notation.   Let . Find the slope of the tangent line to at the point where .    Let . Find the instantaneous rate of change of at the point where .    Let . Find .    Let . Find .    When a mass hangs from a spring and is set in motion, the object's position oscillates in a way that the size of the oscillations decrease. This is usually called a damped oscillation . Suppose that for a particular object, its displacement from equilibrium (where the object sits at rest) is modeled by the function . Assume that is measured in inches and in seconds. Sketch a graph of this function for to see how it represents the situation described. Then compute , state the units on this function, and explain what it tells you about the object's motion. Finally, compute and interpret .          What rule(s) can help you determine ?    Note that is a sum of two functions. What rule is needed to differentiate each term in the sum?    Observe that is a sum of two functions; the first term in the sum is a quotient, while the second is a product.    What is the overall structure of ? What is the algebraic structure of the numerator of ?    Keep in mind that the derivative of position tells us the instantaneous velocity.           .     .     .     .     inches per second.          Using the sum and constant multiple rules along with the formulas for the derivatives of and , we find that . Therefore, the slope of the tangent line to at the point where is given by .    By the sum rule and two applications of the product rule, we have . Thus, the instantaneous rate of change of at the point where is     Using the sum and constant multiple rules, followed by the quotient rule on the first term and the product rule on the second, we find that     Note that is fundamentally a quotient, so we need to use the quotient rule. But the numerator of is a product, so the product rule will be required to compute the derivative of the top function. Executing the quotient rule and proceeding, we find that     By the quotient rule, . The function measures the instantaneous vertical velocity of the mass that is attached to the spring. In particular, inches per second, which tells us at the instant , the mass is moving downward at an instantaneous rate of 2.69 inches per second.         Summary     The derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions are , . Each derivative exists and is defined on the same domain as the original function. For example, both the tangent function and its derivative are defined for all real numbers such that , where .    The four rules for the derivatives of the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant can be used along with the rules for power functions, exponential functions, and the sine and cosine, as well as the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules, to quickly differentiate a wide range of different functions.

The equation of this tangent line can be written in the form where is:  and where is:                  An object moving vertically has its height at time (measured in feet, with time in seconds) given by the function .   What is the object's instantaneous velocity when ?    What is the object's acceleration at the instant ?    Describe in everyday language the behavior of the object at the instant .          feet per second.     feet per second per second.    The object is falling and slowing down.         The object's instantaneous velocity at is given by . Since , by the quotient rule we can determine that . Thus, feet per second is the instanateous (vertical) velocity of the object at .    To find the object's acceleration at , we compute . First, by the quotient rule, . Therefore, the acceleration at is feet per second per second.    At , the object is falling and slowing down. We know the object is falling because its velocity is negative, and slowing down because its negative velocity is increasing (due to being positive) and thus getting less negative.       Let .

Given a composite function that is built from differentiable functions and , how do we compute in terms of , , , and ? What is the statement of the Chain Rule?      In addition to learning how to differentiate a variety of basic functions, we have also been developing our ability to use rules to differentiate certain algebraic combinations of them.    State the rule(s) to find the derivative of each of the following combinations of and : ,  .    Finding uses the sum and constant multiple rules, because . Determining requires the product rule, because . To calculate we use the quotient rule, because .    There is one more natural way to combine basic functions algebraically, and that is by composing them. For instance, let's consider the function , and observe that any input passes through a chain of functions. In the process that defines the function , is first squared, and then the sine of the result is taken. Using an arrow diagram, .  In terms of the elementary functions and , we observe that is the input for the function , and the result is used as the input for . We write and say that is the composition  composition of and . We will refer to , the function that is first applied to , as the inner function, while , the function that is applied to the result, is the outer function.  Given a composite function that is built from differentiable functions and , how do we compute in terms of , , , and ? In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions, , depends on the behavior of both and , it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function will also depend on some combination of and and their derivatives. The rule that describes how to compute in terms of and and their derivatives is called the chain rule .  But before we can learn what the chain rule says and why it works, we first need to be comfortable decomposing composite functions so that we can correctly identify the inner and outer functions, as we did in the example above with .   For each function given below, identify its fundamental algebraic structure. In particular, is the given function a sum, product, quotient, or composition of basic functions? If the function is a composition of basic functions, state a formula for the inner function and the outer function so that the overall composite function can be written in the form . If the function is a sum, product, or quotient of basic functions, use the appropriate rule to determine its derivative.                                     The chain rule  Often a composite function cannot be written in an alternate algebraic form. For instance, the function cannot be expanded or otherwise rewritten, so it presents no alternate approaches to taking the derivative. But some composite functions can be expanded or simplified, and these provide a way to explore how the chain rule works.    Let and . Determine a formula for and compute . How is related to and and their derivatives?    By the rules given for and , .  Thus, . Noting that and , we observe that appears to be the product of and .    It may seem that Example is too elementary to illustrate how to differentiate a composite function. Linear functions are the simplest of all functions, and composing linear functions yields another linear function. While this example does not illustrate the full complexity of a composition of nonlinear functions, at the same time we remember that any differentiable function is locally linear, and thus any function with a derivative behaves like a line when viewed up close. The fact that the derivatives of the linear functions and are multiplied to find the derivative of their composition turns out to be a key insight.  We now consider a composition involving a nonlinear function.    Let . Use the double angle identity to rewrite as a product of basic functions, and use the product rule to find . Rewrite in the simplest form possible.    Using the double angle identity for the sine function, we write .  Applying the product rule and simplifying, we find .  Next, we recall that the double angle identity for the cosine, .  Substituting this result into our expression for , we now have that .    In Example , if we let and , we observe that . Now, and , so we can view the structure of as .  In this example, as in the example involving linear functions, we see that the derivative of the composite function is found by multiplying the derivatives of and , but with evaluated at .  It makes sense intuitively that these two quantities are involved in the rate of change of a composite function: if we ask how fast is changing at a given value, it clearly matters how fast is changing at , as well as how fast is changing at the value of . It turns out that this structure holds for all differentiable functions Like other differentiation rules, the Chain Rule can be proved formally using the limit definition of the derivative. as is stated in the Chain Rule.   Chain Rule   chain rule If is differentiable at and is differentiable at , then the composite function defined by is differentiable at and .   As with the product and quotient rules, it is often helpful to think verbally about what the chain rule says: If is a composite function defined by an outer function and an inner function , then is given by the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function.   It is helpful to identify clearly the inner function and outer function , compute their derivatives individually, and then put all of the pieces together by the chain rule.    Determine the derivative of the function .    The function is composite, with inner function and outer function . Organizing the key information involving , , and their derivatives, we have                     Applying the chain rule, we find that .    As a side note, we remark that is usually written as . This is common notation for powers of trigonometric functions: , , and are all composite functions, with the outer function a power function and the inner function a trigonometric one.    For each function given below, identify an inner function and outer function to write the function in the form . Determine , , and , and then apply the chain rule to determine the derivative of the given function.                                  The outer function is .    The outer function is .    The outer function is .    The outer function is .    The outer function is .           .     .     .     .     .          The outer function is , while the inner function is , and we know that . Hence, by the chain rule, .    The outer function is , while the inner function is , and we know that . Hence, by the chain rule, .    The outer function is , while the inner function is , and we know that . Hence, by the chain rule, .    The outer function is , while the inner function is , and we know that . Hence, by the chain rule, .    The outer function is , while the inner function is , and we know that . Hence, by the chain rule, .         Using multiple rules simultaneously  The chain rule now joins the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules in our collection of techniques for finding the derivative of a function through understanding its algebraic structure and the basic functions that constitute it. It takes practice to get comfortable applying multiple rules to differentiate a single function, but using proper notation and taking a few extra steps will help.    Find a formula for the derivative of .    We first observe that is the product of two functions: , where and . We will need to use the product rule to differentiate . And because and are composite functions, we will need the chain rule. We therefore begin by computing and .  Writing , and finding the derivatives of and , we have                     Thus, by the chain rule, it follows that .  Turning next to , we write and find the derivatives of and .                     By the chain rule, .  Now we are finally ready to compute the derivative of the function . Recalling that , by the product rule we have .  From our work above with and , we know the derivatives of and , and therefore .      For each of the following functions, find the function's derivative. State the rule(s) you use, label relevant derivatives appropriately, and be sure to clearly identify your overall answer.                                  Use the constant multiple rule first, followed by the chain rule.    Observe that is fundamentally a product of composite functions.    Note that is a quotient of composite functions.    The function is a composite function with outer function .    It is possible for a function to be a composite function with more than two functions in the chain.           .     .     .     .     .          By the constant multiple rule, . Using the chain rule to complete the remaining derivative, we see that .    Observe that by the product rule, . Applying the chain rule to differentiate and , we see that .    By the quotient rule, . Applying the chain rule to differentiate and , it follows .    By the chain rule, . Then by the product rule, we find that .    If we first apply the chain rule to the outer function (the sine function), note that . Next, we again apply the chain rule, but this time to , and get .       The chain rule now adds substantially to our ability to compute derivatives. Whether we are finding the equation of the tangent line to a curve, the instantaneous velocity of a moving particle, or the instantaneous rate of change of a certain quantity, if the function under consideration is a composition, the chain rule is indispensable.    Use known derivative rules, including the chain rule, as needed to answer each of the following questions.   Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve at the point where .    If represents the position function of a particle moving horizontally along an axis at time (where is measured in inches and in seconds), find the particle's instantaneous velocity at . Is the particle moving to the left or right at that instant?    At sea level, air pressure is 30 inches of mercury. At an altitude of feet above sea level, the air pressure, , in inches of mercury, is given by the function . Compute and explain what this derivative function tells you about air pressure, including a discussion of the units on . In addition, determine how fast the air pressure is changing for a pilot of a small plane passing through an altitude of feet.    Suppose that and are differentiable functions and that the following information about them is known:   Data for functions and .                          If is a function given by the formula , determine . In addition, if is the function , find .          Let . Find and .    Recall that tells us the instantaneous velocity at time .    Note that the units on are inches of mercury per foot.    Since , it follows . What is ?           .     inches per second; the particle is moving left at the instant .     inches of mercury per foot.     ; .          Let . By the chain rule , and thus . Note further that . The tangent line is therefore the line through with slope , which is .    Observe that , and thus by the chain rule, . We therefore see that inches per second, so the particle is moving left at the instant .    First, . Therefore, inches of mercury per foot. This tells us that the barometric pressure is dropping very slightly for each additional foot of elevation gain.    Since , it follows . Therefore, . From the given table, , so applying this result and using additional given information, . For , the chain rule tells us that , so . Using the given table, it follows .         The composite version of basic function rules  As we gain more experience with differention, we will become more comfortable in simply writing down the derivative without taking multiple steps. This is particularly simple when the inner function is linear, since the derivative of a linear function is a constant.    Use the chain rule to differentiate each of the following composite functions whose inside function is linear: ,  .    More generally, the following is an excellent exercise for getting comfortable with the derivative rules. Write down a list of all the basic functions whose derivatives we know, and list the derivatives. Then write a composite function with the inner function being an unknown function and the outer function being a basic function. Finally, write the chain rule for the composite function. The following example illustrates this for two different functions.    To determine , where is a differentiable function of , we use the chain rule with the sine function as the outer function. Applying the chain rule, we find that . This rule is analogous to the basic derivative rule that .  Similarly, since , it follows by the chain rule that . This rule is analogous to the basic derivative rule that .      Summary     A composite function is one where the input variable first passes through one function, and then the resulting output passes through another. For example, the function is composite since .    Given a composite function where and are differentiable functions, the chain rule tells us that .

At what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to the height of the water at the instant ? What are the units on this quantity?    Now suppose that the height of water in the tank is being regulated by an inflow and outflow (e.g., a faucet and a drain) so that the height of the water at time is given by the rule , where is measured in hours (and is still measured in feet). At what rate is the height of the water changing with respect to time at the instant ?

We are asked to find (the derivative of with respect to the independent variable ) at the instant . If we first expand to write we find that , with units ``cubic feet per foot''. Evaluating at , we get     Since , the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to is , and therefore feet per hour.    First we want to find , the derivative of with respect to the independent variable . Here we can write as a function of by writing , where .

  "body": " Derivatives of Inverse Functions     What is the derivative of the natural logarithm function?    What are the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions and ?    If is the inverse of a differentiable function , how is computed in terms of , , and ?      Much of mathematics centers on the notion of function. Indeed, throughout our study of calculus, we are investigating the behavior of functions, with particular emphasis on how fast the output of the function changes in response to changes in the input. Because each function represents a process, a natural question to ask is whether or not the particular process can be reversed. That is, if we know the output that results from the function, can we determine the input that led to it? And if we know how fast a particular process is changing, can we determine how fast the inverse process is changing?  One of the most important functions in all of mathematics is the natural exponential function . Its inverse, the natural logarithm, , is similarly important. One of our goals in this section is to learn how to differentiate the logarithm function. First, we review some of the basic concepts surrounding functions and their inverses.   The equation relates a temperature given in degrees Fahrenheit to the corresponding temperature measured in degrees Celsius.   Solve the equation for to write (Fahrenheit temperature) in terms of (Celsius temperature).    Let be the function that takes a Fahrenheit temperature as input and produces the Celsius temperature as output. In addition, let be the function that converts a temperature given in degrees Celsius to the temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Use your work in (a) to write a formula for .    Next consider the new function defined by . Use the formulas for and to determine an expression for and simplify this expression as much as possible. What do you observe?    Now, let . Use the formulas for and to determine an expression for and simplify this expression as much as possible. What do you observe?    What is the value of ? of ? How do these values appear to be related?        Basic facts about inverse functions  A function function  is a rule that associates each element in the set to one and only one element in the set . We call the domain  domain of and the codomain  codomain of . If there exists a function such that for every possible choice of in the set and for every in the set , then we say that is the inverse of .  We often use the notation (read -inverse ) to denote the inverse of . The inverse function undoes the work of . Indeed, if , then . Thus, the equations and say the same thing. The only difference between the two equations is one of perspective one is solved for , while the other is solved for .  Here we briefly remind ourselves of some key facts about inverse functions.   For a function ,    has an inverse if and only if is one-to-one one-to-one A function is one-to-one provided that no two distinct inputs lead to the same output. and onto onto A function is onto provided that every possible element of the codomain can be realized as an output of the function for some choice of input from the domain. ;    provided exists, the domain of is the codomain of , and the codomain of is the domain of ;     for every in the domain of and for every in the codomain of ;     if and only if .      The last fact reveals a special relationship between the graphs of and . If a point that lies on the graph of , then it is also true that , which means that the point lies on the graph of . This shows us that the graphs of and are the reflections of each other across the line , because this reflection is precisely the geometric action that swaps the coordinates in an ordered pair. In Figure , we see this illustrated by the function and its inverse, with the points and highlighting the reflection of the curves across .   A graph of a function along with its inverse, .    To close our review of important facts about inverses, we recall that the natural exponential function has an inverse function, namely the natural logarithm, . Thus, writing is interchangeable with , plus for every real number and for every positive real number .    The derivative of the natural logarithm function  In what follows, we find a formula for the derivative of . To do so, we take advantage of the fact that we know the derivative of the natural exponential function, the inverse of . In particular, we know that writing is equivalent to writing . Now we differentiate both sides of this equation and observe that .  The righthand side is simply ; by applying the chain rule to the left side, we find that .  Next we solve for , to get .  Finally, we recall that , so , and thus .   Natural Logarithm   derivative logarithm For all positive real numbers , .   This rule for the natural logarithm function now joins our list of basic derivative rules. Note that this rule applies only to positive values of , as these are the only values for which is defined.  Also notice that for the first time in our work, differentiating a basic function of a particular type has led to a function of a very different nature: the derivative of the natural logarithm is not another logarithm, nor even an exponential function, but rather a rational one.  Derivatives of logarithms may now be computed in concert with all of the rules known to date. For instance, if , then by the chain rule, .  There are interesting connections between the graphs of and .   In Figure , we are reminded that since the natural exponential function has the property that its derivative is itself, the slope of the tangent to is equal to the height of the curve at that point. For instance, at the point , the slope of the tangent line is , and at , the tangent line's slope is .   A graph of the function along with its inverse, , where both functions are viewed using the input variable .     At the corresponding points and on the graph of the natural logarithm function (which come from reflecting and across the line ), we know that the slope of the tangent line is the reciprocal of the -coordinate of the point (since ). Thus, at , we have , and at , .  In particular, we observe that and . This is not a coincidence, but in fact holds for any curve and its inverse, provided the inverse exists. This is due to the reflection across . It changes the roles of and , thus reversing the rise and run, so the slope of the inverse function at the reflected point is the reciprocal of the slope of the original function.    For each function given below, find its derivative.                                  Is a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?    Is a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?    Is a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?    Is a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?

Again using the chain rule, .    Noting that is composite with the natural logarithm function serving as both the inner and outer function, we find that .         Inverse trigonometric functions and their derivatives  Trigonometric functions are periodic, so they fail to be one-to-one, and thus do not have inverse functions. However, we can restrict the domain of each trigonometric function so that it is one-to-one on that domain.  For instance, consider the sine function on the domain . Because no output of the sine function is repeated on this interval, the function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse. Thus, the function with and codomain has an inverse function such that .   We call the arcsine  arcsine (or inverse sine) function and write . It is especially important to remember that say the same thing. The arcsine of means the angle whose sine is . For example, means that is the angle whose sine is , which is equivalent to writing .   A graph of (in blue), restricted to the domain , along with its inverse, (in magenta).     Next, we determine the derivative of the arcsine function. Letting , our goal is to find . Since is the angle whose sine is , it is equivalent to write .  Differentiating both sides of the previous equation, we have . The righthand side is simply , and by applying the chain rule applied to the left side, .  Solving for , it follows that .  Finally, we recall that , so the denominator of is the function , or in other words, the cosine of the angle whose sine is . A bit of right triangle trigonometry allows us to simplify this expression considerably.   Let's say that , so that is the angle whose sine is . We can picture as an angle in a right triangle with hypotenuse and a vertical leg of length , as shown in Figure . The horizontal leg must be , by the Pythagorean Theorem.   The right triangle that corresponds to the angle .     Now, because , the expression for is equivalent to . From the figure, .  Substituting this expression into our formula, , we have now shown that .   Inverse sine   derivative arcsine For all real numbers such that , .

In particular, we observed that at the point on the graph of , the slope of the tangent line is , while at the corresponding point on the graph of , the slope of the tangent line is , which is the reciprocal of .  That the two corresponding tangent lines have reciprocal slopes is not a coincidence. If and are differentiable inverse functions, then if and only if , then for every in the domain of . Differentiating both sides of this equation, we have , and by the chain rule, .  Solving for , we have .

Now, applying the rule that to the value , we have , which is precisely what we see in the figure: the slope of the tangent line to at is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to at , since these two lines are reflections of one another across the line .

How does implicit differentiation enable us to find a formula for when is an implicit function of ?    In the context of an implicit curve, how can we use to answer important questions about the tangent line to the curve?      In all of our studies with derivatives so far, we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of . But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving and are impossible to solve for in terms of .   At left, the circle given by . In the middle, the portion of the circle that has been highlighted in the box at left. And at right, the curve given by .    Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles. Because of the circle's symmetry, for each value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter, there are two corresponding -values. For instance, in Figure , we have labeled and , and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test. Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form . But portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of , such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of Figure . Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear, so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point. Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute at any point on the circle, even though we cannot write explicitly as a function of .  We say that the equation defines  implicitly as a function of . The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of . For the circle, we could choose to take the top half as one explicit function of , namely and the bottom half as the explicit function . The equation for the circle defines an implicit function of . implicit function   The righthand curve in Figure is called the folium of Descartes  folium of Descartes and is just one of many fascinating possibilities for implicitly given curves.  How can we find an equation for without an explicit formula for in terms of ? The following preview activity reminds us of some ways we can compute derivatives of functions in settings where the function's formula is not known.   Let be a differentiable function of (whose formula is not known) and recall that and are interchangeable notations. Determine each of the following derivatives of combinations of explicit functions of , the unknown function , and an arbitrary constant .                                Implicit Differentiation  We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle given by . How can we find a formula for ?  By viewing as an implicit function of , we think of as some function whose formula is unknown, but which we can differentiate. Just as represents an unknown formula, so too its derivative with respect to , , will be (at least temporarily) unknown.  So we view as an unknown differentiable function of and differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to . .  On the right, the derivative of the constant is , and on the left we can apply the sum rule, so it follows that .  Note carefully the different roles being played by and . Because is the independent variable, . But is the dependent variable and is an implicit function of . Recall Preview Activity , where we computed . Computing is the same, and requires the chain rule, by which we find that . We now have that .  We solve this equation for by subtracting from both sides and dividing by . .  There are several important things to observe about the result that . First, this expression for the derivative involves both and . This makes sense because there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of between and , and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.   Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles. The slope of the radius from the origin to the point is . The tangent line to the circle at is perpendicular to the radius, and thus has slope , as shown in Figure . In particular, the slope of the tangent line is zero at and , and is undefined at and . All of these values are consistent with the formula .   The circle given by with point on the circle and the tangent line at that point, with labeled slopes of the radial line, , and tangent line, .       For the curve given implicitly by , shown in Figure , find the slope of the tangent line at .   The curve .      We begin by differentiating the curve's equation implicitly. Taking the derivative of each side with respect to , , by the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have .  For the three derivatives we now must execute, the first uses the simple power rule, the second requires the chain rule (since is an implicit function of ), and the third necessitates the product rule (again since is a function of ). Applying these rules, we now find that .  We want to solve this equation for . To do so, we first collect all of the terms involving on one side of the equation. .  Then we factor the left side to isolate . .  Finally, we divide both sides by and conclude that .  Note that the expression for depends on both and . To find the slope of the tangent line at , we substitute the coordinates into the formula for , using the notation .  This value matches our visual estimate of the slope of the tangent line shown in Figure .     Example shows that it is possible when differentiating implicitly to have multiple terms involving . We use addition and subtraction to collect all terms involving on one side of the equation, then factor to get a single term of . Finally, we divide to solve for .  We use the notation to denote the evaluation of at the point . This is analogous to writing when depends on a single variable.  There is a big difference between writing and . For example, gives an instruction to take the derivative with respect to of the quantity , presumably where is a function of . On the other hand, means the product of the derivative of with respect to with the quantity . Understanding this notational subtlety is essential.    Consider the curve defined by the equation , whose graph is pictured in Figure .      Explain why it is not possible to express as an explicit function of .    Use implicit differentiation to find a formula for .    Use your result from part (b) to find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of at the point .    Use your result from part (b) to determine all of the points at which the graph of has a vertical tangent line.      The curve .          Does the graph pass the vertical line test?    Note, for instance, that .    Remember the meaning of .    What is the slope of a vertical line?          The graph of the curve fails the vertical line test.     .     .     , , , and .          Because the graph of the curve fails the vertical line test, cannot be a function of . This also confirms our intuition that there is not an algebraic means by which we can rearrange the equation to write in terms of .    We differentiate implicitly, taking the derivative of each side with respect to , , and evaluate the elementary derivative on the left and use the sum rule on the right to find that . By the chain and constant multiple rules, viewing as a function of , we now have . Factoring, , and therefore .    To find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of at the point , we only need the slope of the tangent line. Hence we compute . Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is or .    Since a line is vertical whenever its slope is undefined, we seek all points that make undefined. This will occur precisely when the denominator, , is zero. Using a graphing utility or computer algebra system to solve the equation , we find that this happens at the four approximate -values . For each such value, we use the original equation to find the -value of the point. Doing so, we have established that there are four points at which the tangent line is vertical, and they are approximately , , , and .       It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal. The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero, while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined. Often the formula for is expressed as a quotient of functions of and , say .  The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero, making the slope of the tangent line zero. If we can solve the equation for either and in terms of the other, we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve. This gives an equation in a single variable, and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where . At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.  Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever and , making the slope undefined.    Consider the curve defined by the equation , whose graph is pictured in Figure . Through implicit differentiation, it can be shown that . Use this fact to answer each of the following questions.      Determine all points at which the tangent line to the curve is horizontal. (Use technology appropriately to find the needed zeros of the relevant polynomial function.)    Determine all points at which the tangent line is vertical. (Use technology appropriately to find the needed zeros of the relevant polynomial function.)    Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at one of the points where .      .          Note that the numerator of is a quadratic function of .    The denominator of is a cubic function of .    When , then must satisfy the equation .          Horizontal at , thus . There are four more points where .    When , so one point is .     .          To find where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal, we set , which requires that the numerator be zero, or in other words that . Expanding and combining like terms, we find that , which occurs where . From the graph in Figure , we observe that at each such -value, there are several corresponding -values for which the tangent line will be horizontal. For instance, when , then must satisfy the equation . Because this is a quartic equation (degree 4) equation in , we use computational technology to help us find the solutions. Doing so, we find four approximate values for , , and thus our estimates for four points at which the tangent line is horizontal are . Similar work can be done to find the four points at which the tangent line is horizontal when .    The tangent line to the curve is vertical wherever is undefined, which occurs precisely where . Expanding and combining like terms, we see that we need to solve the cubic equation ; using a computer algebra system, we find that this occurs when . It now remains to find the -coordinate that corresponds to each such -value. For instance, when , must satisfy , or in other words, . Here, too, we use technology to determine that there is only one such , and . Similar work can be done to find the -values that correspond to .    There are four points on the curve where , which correspond to the -values that satisfy : , , , . We choose the point and evaluate at this point. Doing so, . Thus, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at is .         For each of the following curves, use implicit differentiation to find and determine the equation of the tangent line at the given point.    ,      ,      ,           Note that requires the product rule.    With being a function of , requires the chain rule.    To calculate , first use the product rule and temporarily defer computing .           and the tangent line has equation .     and the tangent line has equation .     and the tangent line is .          Differentiating with respect to , , so that by the chain and product rules we have . Rearranging to get all terms with on the same side, it follows that , and thus . Finally, we have established that , so evaluating at , we have . Thus, the tangent line has equation .    After differentiating with respect to , we have . Taking the usual steps to solve for , we find that . Evaluating the slope of the tangent line at , we have , and thus the tangent line at has equation .    When we differentiate both sides with respect to , , we first observe that the product rule is needed on the left and the chain rule on the right. Applying those rules, we have . Next, we apply the chain rule to differentiate , which yields . Finally, to complete the process of differentiation, we use the product rule and get . To solve for , we first expand to have , and then the usual algebraic work may be done to deduce that . Evaluating at the point , it follows that the slope of the tangent line is . Thus, the tangent line is given by .         Summary     In an equation involving and where portions of the graph can be defined by explicit functions of , we say that is an implicit function of . A good example of such a curve is the unit circle.    We use implicit differentiation to differentiate an implicitly defined function. We differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to , treating as a function of by applying the chain rule. If possible, we subsequently solve for using algebra.    While may now involve both the variables and , still gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve.

  "body": " Using Derivatives to Evaluate Limits     How can derivatives be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form ?    What does it mean to say that and ?    How can derivatives assist us in evaluating indeterminate limits of the form ?      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the derivative involves a limit, there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits. In addition, the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form . If is a differentiable function, then in the definition , not only does in the denominator, but also in the numerator, since is continuous. Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do: indeed, limits of the form can take on any value, as is evidenced by evaluating for varying values of for a function such as .  We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that result from the derivative definition, including a large number of shortcut rules. In this section, we turn the situation upside-down: instead of using limits to evaluate derivatives, we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.   Let be the function given by .   What is the domain of ?    Explain why results in an indeterminate form.    Next we will investigate the behavior of both the numerator and denominator of near the point where . Let and . Find the local linearizations of and at , and call these functions and , respectively.    Explain why for near .    Using your work from (c) and (d), evaluate . What do you think your result tells us about ?    Investigate the function graphically and numerically near . What do you think is the value of ?        Using derivatives to evaluate indeterminate limits of the form .   At left, the graphs of and near the value , along with their tangent line approximations and at . At right, zooming in on the point and the four graphs.    The idea demonstrated in Preview Activity  that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits. We have a function that can be written as a quotient , where and are both differentiable at and for which . We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by . Figure illustrates the situation. We see that both and have an -intercept at . Their respective tangent line approximations and at are also shown in the figure. We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as .  First, let's recall that and . Because is getting arbitrarily close to when we take the limit, we can replace with and replace with , and thus we observe that .  Next, we remember that both and , which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate. Substituting these values for and in the limit above, we now have , where the latter equality holds because when is approaching (but not equal to) . Finally, we note that is constant with respect to , and thus .  This result holds as long as is not equal to zero. The formal name of the result is L'Hôpital's Rule.   L'Hôpital's Rule  L'Hôpital's rule  Let and be differentiable at , and suppose that and that . Then .   In practice, we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hôpital's Rule, which states that (under the identical assumptions as the boxed rule above and the extra assumption that is continuous at ) , provided the righthand limit exists. This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hôpital's Rule: if produces an indeterminate limit of form as , that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives, .  For example, if we consider the limit from Preview Activity , , by L'Hôpital's Rule we have that   By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives, we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.    Evaluate each of the following limits. If you use L'Hôpital's Rule, indicate where it was used, and be certain its hypotheses are met before you apply it.                             Remember that .    Note that , not .    Observe that as .    If necessary, L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied more than once.           .     .     .     .          As , we see that , thus this limit has an indeterminate form. By L'Hôpital's Rule, we have . As this limit is no longer indeterminate, we may simply allow , and thus we find that .    Observe that , since this limit is not indeterminate because the function is continuous at .    Since and as , this limit is indeterminate with form . Hence, by L'Hôpital's Rule, . The updated limit is not indeterminate, and allowing , we find .    Since the given limit is indeterminate of form , by L'Hôpital's Rule we have . Now, as , and , which makes the latest limit also indeterminate in form . Applying L'Hôpital's Rule a second time, we now have . In the newest limit, we note that but as , so the numerator is tending to 0 while the denominator is approaching . Thus, the value of the limit is determined to be .       While L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied in an entirely algebraic way, it is important to remember that the justification of the rule is graphical: the main idea is that the slopes of the tangent lines to and at determine the value of the limit of as .   Two functions and that satisfy L'Hôpital's Rule.    We see this in Figure , where we can see from the grid that and , hence by L'Hôpital's Rule, .  It's not the fact that and both approach zero that matters most, but rather the rate at which each approaches zero that determines the value of the limit. This is a good way to remember what L'Hôpital's Rule says: if , the the limit of as is given by the ratio of the slopes of and at .    In this activity, we reason graphically from the following figure to evaluate limits of ratios of functions about which some information is known.   Three graphs referenced in the questions of Activity .       Use the left-hand graph to determine the values of , , , and . Then, evaluate .    Use the middle graph to find , , , and . Then, determine the value of .    Assume that and are functions whose for which and Use the right-hand graph to compute , , , . Explain why you cannot determine the exact value of without further information being provided, but that you can determine the sign of . In addition, state what the sign of the limit will be, with justification.          Don't forget that measures the slope of the tangent line to at the point .    Do the functions and meet the criteria of L'Hôpital's Rule?    Remember that L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied more than once to a particular limit.           .     .     .          From the given graph, we observe that , , , and . By L'Hôpital's Rule, .    The given graph tells us that , , , and . Note well that the given limit, , is not indeterminate, and thus L'Hôpital's Rule does not apply. Rather, since and as , we have that .    From the third graph, , , , . By L'Hôpital's Rule, , but this limit is still indeterminate, so by L'Hôpital's Rule again, , provided that . Since we do not know the values of and , we can't determine the actual value of the limit, but from the graph it appears that (since is concave up) and that (because is concave down), and therefore .         Limits involving  The concept of infinity, infinity denoted , arises naturally in calculus, as it does in much of mathematics. It is important to note from the outset that is a concept, but not a number itself. Indeed, the notion of naturally invokes the idea of limits. Consider, for example, the function , whose graph is pictured in Figure .  We note that is not in the domain of , so we may naturally wonder what happens as . As , we observe that  increases without bound . That is, we can make the value of as large as we like by taking closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, while keeping . This is a good way to think about what infinity represents: a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.   The graph of .    Recall that the statement , means that we can make as close to as we'd like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either or can be . For instance, for , we now write , by which we mean that we can make as large as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to 0. In a similar way, we write , since we can make as close to 0 as we'd like by taking sufficiently large (i.e., by letting increase without bound).  In general, the notation means that we can make as large as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to , and the notation means that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently large. This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits, and to limits involving . For example, returning to Figure and , we can say that .  Finally, we write if we can make the value of as large as we'd like by taking sufficiently large. For example, .  Limits involving infinity identify vertical and horizontal asymptotes  asymptote  asymptote vertical  asymptote horizontal of a function. If , then is a vertical asymptote of , while if , then is a horizontal asymptote of . Similar statements can be made using , and with left- and right-hand limits as or .  In precalculus classes, it is common to study the end behavior of certain families of functions, by which we mean the behavior of a function as and as . Here we briefly examine some familiar functions and note the values of several limits involving .   Graphs of some familiar functions whose end behavior as is known. In the middle graph, and .    For the natural exponential function , we note that and . For the exponential decay function , these limits are reversed, with and . Turning to the natural logarithm function, we have and . While both and grow without bound as , the exponential function does so much more quickly than the logarithm function does. We'll soon use limits to quantify what we mean by quickly.   For polynomial functions of the form , the end behavior depends on the sign of and whether the highest power is even or odd. If is even and is positive, then and , as in the plot of in Figure . If instead is negative, then and . In the situation where is odd, then either and (which occurs when is positive, as in the graph of in Figure ), or and (when is negative).  A function can fail to have a limit as . For example, consider the plot of the sine function at right in Figure . Because the function continues oscillating between and as , we say that does not exist.  Finally, it is straightforward to analyze the behavior of any rational function as .    Determine the limit of the function as .  Note that both as and as . Here we say that has indeterminate form . We can determine the value of this limit through a standard algebraic approach. Multiplying the numerator and denominator each by , we find that since and as . This shows that the rational function has a horizontal asymptote at . A similar approach can be used to determine the limit of any rational function as .    But how should we handle a limit such as   Here, both and , but there is not an obvious algebraic approach that enables us to find the limit's value. Fortunately, it turns out that L'Hôpital's Rule extends to cases involving infinity.   L'Hôpital's Rule ( )  L'Hôpital's rule (at infinity)  If and are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach as (where is allowed to be ) , then , provided the righthand limit exists.   (To be technically correct, we need to add the additional hypothesis that on an open interval that contains or in every neighborhood of infinity if is ; this is almost always met in practice.)  To evaluate , we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule, since both and . Doing so, it follows that .  This updated limit is still indeterminate and of the form , but it is simpler since has replaced . Hence, we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule again, and find that .  Now, since is constant and as , it follows that as , which shows that .    Evaluate each of the following limits. If you use L'Hôpital's Rule, indicate where it was used, and be certain its hypotheses are met before you apply it.                                  Remember that as .    Both the numerator and denominator tend to as .    Note that , not .    As , .    Observe that .           .     .     .     .     .          As both numerator and denominator tend to as , by L'Hôpital's Rule followed by some elementary algebra, .    Because this limit has indeterminate form , L'Hôpital's Rule tells us that . The latest limit is indeterminate for the same reason, and a second application of the rule shows . Note how each application of the rule produces a simpler numerator and denominator. With one more use of L'Hôpital's Rule, followed by a simple algebraic simplification, we have .    As , and , thus by L'Hôpital's Rule, . Reciprocating, multiplying, and simplifying, it follows that .    Here, the numerator tends to while the denominator tends to . Note well that this limit is not indeterminate, but rather produces a collection of fractions with large positive numerators and small negative denominators. Hence . In particular, we observe that L'Hôpital's Rule is not applicable here.    In its original form, , is indeterminate of form . Rewriting as , a straightforward application of L'Hôpital's Rule tells us that . Since as , we find that .       To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions that results in an indeterminate form of , in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound. We say that the function  dominates the function as provided that , whereas dominates provided that . Finally, if the value of is finite and nonzero, we say that and  grow at the same rate . For example, we saw that , so dominates , while , so and grow at the same rate.    Summary     Derivatives can be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form through L'Hôpital's Rule, by replacing the functions in the numerator and denominator with their tangent line approximations. In particular, if and and are differentiable at , L'Hôpital's Rule tells us that .    When we write , this means that is increasing without bound. Thus, means that we can make as close to as we like by choosing to be sufficiently large. Similarly, , means that we can make as large as we like by choosing sufficiently close to .    A version of L'Hôpital's Rule also helps us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form . If and are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach as (where is allowed to be ), then .

Provide explanation to support your conclusion.    .      See the figure below for possible graphs of and . To evaluate the limit, we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule twice. Since , we know by the rule that . Since , the limit is still indeterminate, and we can apply the rule again to get . Hence, .       Find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function , where , , and are distinct, arbitrary constants. In addition, state all values of for which is not continuous. Sketch a possible graph of , clearly labeling the values of , , and .   Horizontal asymptote: ; vertical asymptote: ; hole: . is not continuous at and .      First, we note that since both the numerator and denominator of are quadratic, the limit as can be found by taking the quotient of the leading coefficients. In particular, and thus the horizontal asymptote of is .  Next, since and are distinct, we see that the numerator of is zero (and the denominator is not) when , and thus . In addition, the denominator is zero (and the numerator is not) when , and this results in there being a vertical asymptote at .  Finally, we observe that makes both the numerator and denominator zero. Since is thus not defined, the graph of has either a hole or a vertical asymptote at . To determine which, we evaluate the limit and see that . This tells us that has a hole at the point . Moreover, is not continuous at and .  A possible graph of is shown in the following figure.       Consider the function , which is defined for all . Observe that is indeterminate due to its form of . (Think about how we know that for all , while for all , but that neither rule can apply to .)

Since as and as , we see that is of an indeterminate form to which we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule. Doing so, Simplifying algebraically, Hence, it follows that .    Having shown that and recalling that , we know that as , the natural log of tends to .

Thus, it follows that , and hence dominates .    Using a similar argument to our work in , we can show that dominates for any positive integer . In particular, by L'Hôpital's Rule and some simplifying algebra, . Since , it follows that we've shown that dominates for any positive integer .    To see why will dominate any polynomial function, consider . If we consider the limit of their quotient and apply LHR once, we see that By repeated application of LHR, the numerator (regardless of what polynomial we start with) will eventually be simply a constant (after applications of LHR), and thus with still in the denominator, the overall limit will be .

  "title": "Using derivatives to identify extreme values",
  "body": " Using derivatives to identify extreme values     What are the critical numbers of a function and how are they connected to identifying the most extreme values the function achieves?    How does the first derivative of a function reveal important information about the behavior of the function, including the function's extreme values?    How can the second derivative of a function be used to help identify extreme values of the function?      In many different settings, we are interested in knowing where a function achieves its least and greatest values. These can be important in applications say to identify a point at which maximum profit or minimum cost occurs or in theory to characterize the behavior of a function or a family of related functions.  Consider the simple and familiar example of a parabolic function such as (shown at left in Figure ) that represents the height of an object tossed vertically: its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola and represents the greatest height the object reaches. This maximum value is an especially important point on the graph, the point at which the curve changes from increasing to decreasing.   At left, whose vertex is ; at right, a function that demonstrates several high and low points.      Given a function , we say that is a global or absolute maximum  maximum global  maximum absolute of provided that for all in the domain of , and similarly we call a global  minimum global or absolute minimum  minimum absolute of whenever for all in the domain of .    For instance, on the right in Figure , has a global maximum of , but does not appear to have a global minimum, as the graph of seems to decrease indefinitely. Note that the point marks a fundamental change in the behavior of , where changes from increasing to decreasing; similar things happen at both and , although these points are not global minima or maxima.    We say that is a local maximum  maximum local or relative maximum  maximum relative of provided that for all near , and is called a local  minimum local or relative minimum  minimum relative of whenever for all near .    For example, on the right in Figure , has a relative minimum of at the point and a relative maximum of at . We have already identified the global maximum of as ; it can also be considered a relative maximum. Any maximum or minimum may also be called an extreme value  extreme value of .  We would like to use calculus ideas to identify and classify key function behavior, including the location of relative extremes. Of course, if we are given a graph of a function, it is often straightforward to locate these important behaviors visually.   Consider the function given by the graph in Figure . Use the graph to answer each of the following questions.   The graph of a function on the interval .       Identify all of the values of such that for which is a local maximum of .    Identify all of the values of such that for which is a local minimum of .    Does have a global maximum on the interval ? If so, what is the value of this global maximum?    Does have a global minimum on the interval ? If so, what is its value?    Identify all values of for which .    Identify all values of for which does not exist.    True or false: every relative maximum and minimum of on the interval occurs at a point such that where is either zero or does not exist.    True or false: at every point where is zero or does not exist on the interval , has a relative maximum or minimum.        Critical numbers and the first derivative test   From left to right, a function with a relative maximum where its derivative is zero; a function with a relative maximum where its derivative is undefined; a function with neither a maximum nor a minimum at a point where its derivative is zero; a function with a relative minimum where its derivative is zero; and a function with a relative minimum where its derivative is undefined.    As seen in Figure , when a continuous function defined on changes from being always increasing on interval to being always decreasing on interval (where ), the function has a relative maximum at . Similarly, when a continuous function defined on changes from being always decreasing on interval to being always increasing on interval , the function has a relative minimum at . Because the sign of the derivative changes at such locations, there are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur: either or is undefined. Because these values of are so important, we call them critical numbers .    We say that a function has a critical number  critical number at provided that is in the domain of , and either or is undefined.    Critical numbers are the only possible locations where the function may have relative extremes. Note that not every critical number produces a maximum or minimum; in the middle graph of Figure , the function pictured there has a horizontal tangent line at the noted point, but the function is increasing before and increasing after, so the critical number does not yield a maximum or minimum.  When is a critical number, we say that is a critical point  critical point of the function, or that is a critical value . critical value The first derivative test  first derivative test summarizes how sign changes in the first derivative (which can only occur at critical numbers) indicate the presence of a local maximum or minimum for a given function.   First Derivative Test   first derivative test Let be a critical number of a continuous function that is differentiable near (except possibly at ). If changes sign from positive to negative at , then has a relative maximum at . If changes sign from negative to positive at , then has a relative minimum at .     In Example , we show how to apply the First Derivative Test to determine whether relative maxima or minima occur at various critical numbers and introduce the idea of a sign chart to visualize important function and derivative behavior. sign chart     Let be a function whose derivative is given by the formula . Determine all critical numbers of and decide whether a relative maximum, relative minimum, or neither occurs at each.    Since we already have written in factored form, it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of . Because is defined for all values of , we need only determine where . From the equation and the zero product property, it follows that and are critical numbers of . (There is no value of that makes .)  Next, to apply the first derivative test, we'd like to know the sign of at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of must be the same for every . We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of on the relevant intervals, along with the corresponding behavior of .   The first derivative sign chart for a function whose derivative is given by the formula .    To produce the first derivative sign chart in Figure we identify the sign of each factor of at one selected point in each interval. For instance, for , we could determine the sign of , , and at the value . We note that both and are positive regardless of the value of , while is also positive at . Hence, each of the three terms in is positive, which we indicate by writing . Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for , which we denote by the in the interval to the left of . And, since is positive on that interval, we know that is increasing, so we write INC to represent the behavior of . In a similar way, we find that is positive and is increasing on , and is negative and is decreasing for .  Now we look for critical numbers at which changes sign. In this example, changes sign only at , from positive to negative, so has a relative maximum at . Although has a critical number at , since is increasing both before and after , has neither a minimum nor a maximum at .      Suppose that is a function continuous for every value of whose first derivative is . Further, assume that it is known that has a vertical asymptote at .   Determine all critical numbers of .    By developing a carefully labeled first derivative sign chart, decide whether has as a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at each critical number.    Does have a global maximum? global minimum? Justify your claims.    What is the value of ? What does the value of this limit tell you about the long-term behavior of ?    Sketch a possible graph of .          For which is ?    Note that is positive for all .    Use your first derivative sign chart from (b).    Try expanding the numerator before evaluating the limit.    Think carefully about the information from the sign chart found in (b).           or .     has a local maximum at and neither a max nor min at .     does not have a global minimum; it is unclear (at this point in our work) if increases without bound, so we can't say for certain whether or not has a global maximum.     .    A possible graph of is the following.             Since , we see that implies that or . While makes undefined, we are told that has a vertical asymptote at , so is not in the domain of , and hence is technically not a critical number of . Nonetheless, we place on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which may change sign.    The first derivative sign chart shows that for , for , for , and for . By the first derivative test, has a local maximum at and neither a max nor min at . As these are the only two critical numbers, these are the only two locations for possible extremes. (Note: although changes from decreasing to increasing at , this is due to a vertical asymptote, and does not have a minimum there.)    Because is decreasing as (where has a vertical asymptote), does not have a global minimum. For , is always increasing, which suggests that does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that increases without bound).    We observe that Since as , this tells us that increases without bound as .    From all of our work above, we know that has a local maximum at , a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at , and a vertical asymptote at , plus and both increase without bound as . Thus, a possible graph of is the following.            The second derivative test  Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself. For instance, if is positive on an interval, then we know that is increasing on that interval and, consequently, that is concave up, so throughout that interval the tangent line to lies below the curve at every point. At a point where , the sign of the second derivative determines whether has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number .   Four possible graphs of a function with a horizontal tangent line at a critical point.    In Figure , we see the four possibilities for a function that has a critical number at which , provided is not zero on an interval including (except possibly at ). On either side of the critical number, can be either positive or negative, and hence can be either concave up or concave down. In the first two graphs, does not change concavity at , and in those situations, has either a local minimum or local maximum. In particular, if and , then is concave down at with a horizontal tangent line, so has a local maximum there. This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when is positive, is the substance of the second derivative test .   Second Derivative Test   second derivative test If is a critical number of a continuous function such that and , then has a relative maximum at if and only if , and has a relative minimum at if and only if .   In the event that , the second derivative test is inconclusive. That is, the test doesn't provide us any information. This is because if , it is possible that has a local minimum, local maximum, or neither. Consider the functions , , and at the critical point .  Just as a first derivative sign chart reveals all of the increasing and decreasing behavior of a function, we can construct a second derivative sign chart that demonstrates all of the important information involving concavity.    Let be a function whose first derivative is . Construct both first and second derivative sign charts for , fully discuss where is increasing and decreasing and concave up and concave down, identify all relative extreme values, and sketch a possible graph of .    Since we know , we can find the critical numbers of by solving . Factoring, we observe that , so that are the three critical numbers of . The first derivative sign chart for is given in Figure .   The first derivative sign chart for when .    We see that is increasing on the intervals and , and is decreasing on and . By the first derivative test, this information tells us that has a local maximum at and a local minimum at . Although also has a critical number at , neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since does not change sign at .  Next, we move on to investigate concavity. Differentiating , we see that . Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which is positive and negative, we first find where . Observe that . This equation has solutions . Building a sign chart for in the exact same way we do for , we see the result shown in Figure .   The second derivative sign chart for when .    Therefore, is concave down on the intervals and , and concave up on and .  Putting all of this information together, we now see a complete and accurate possible graph of in Figure .   A possible graph of the function in Example .    The point is a local maximum, because is increasing prior to and decreasing after; similarly, the point is a local minimum. Note, too, that is concave down at and concave up at , which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points and , concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in Figure . Finally, at point , has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there, since is decreasing both before and after . It is also the case that concavity changes at .  While we completely understand where is increasing and decreasing, where is concave up and concave down, and where has relative extremes, we do not know any specific information about the -coordinates of points on the curve. For instance, while we know that has a local maximum at , we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know . Any vertical translation of our sketch of in Figure would satisfy the given criteria for .    Points , , and in Figure are locations at which the concavity of changes. We give a special name to any such point.    If is a value in the domain of a continuous function at which changes concavity, then we say that is an inflection point  inflection point (or point of inflection ) of .    Just as we look for locations where changes from increasing to decreasing at points where or is undefined, so too we find where or is undefined to see if there are points of inflection at these locations.  At this point in our study, it is important to remind ourselves of the big picture that derivatives help to paint: the sign of the first derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing, while the sign of the second derivative tells us how the function is increasing or decreasing.    Suppose that is a function whose second derivative, , is given by the graph in Figure .   The graph of .       Find the -coordinates of all points of inflection of .    Fully describe the concavity of by making an appropriate sign chart.    Suppose you are given that . Is there is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither (for the function ) at this critical number of , or is it impossible to say? Why?    Assuming that is a polynomial (and that all important behavior of is seen in the graph above), what degree polynomial do you think is? Why?          What must be true of at a point of inflection?    Use the given graph to decide where is positive and negative.    What does the second derivative test say?    Can you guess a formula for based on its graph?           is an inflection point of .     is concave up for , concave down for , and concave down for .     has a local minimum at .     is a degree 5 polynomial.          Based on the given graph of , the only point at which changes sign is , and hence this is an inflection point of .    Note that for , for , and for . This tells us that is concave up for , concave down for , and concave down for .    Given that , we know that has a horizontal tangent line at this critical number. In addition, from the given graph of , we see that and observe that is concave up at -values near . By the second derivative test, has a local minimum at .    From the given graph, since has a simple zero at and a repeated zero at , it appears that is a degree 3 polynomial. If so, then is a degree 4 polynomial, and is a degree 5 polynomial.       As we will see in more detail in the following section, derivatives also help us to understand families of functions that differ only by changing one or more parameters. For instance, we might be interested in understanding the behavior of all functions of the form where , , and are parameters. Each parameter has considerable impact on how the graph appears.    Consider the family of functions given by , where is an arbitrary positive real number.     Use a graphing utility to sketch the graph of for several different -values, including . Plot on the axes provided. What is the smallest value of at which you think you can see (just by looking at the graph) at least one inflection point on the graph of ?   Axes for plotting .      Explain why the graph of has no inflection points if , but infinitely many inflection points if .    Explain why, no matter the value of , can only have finitely many critical numbers.          Be sure to try some values between 1.5 and 2.    Treat as an arbitrary constant in computing and .    What is the largest value of ? How many times can intersect the line ?          In the graph below, is given in dark blue, while is shown in light blue.       If , then the equation has no solution. Hence, whenever , or , it follows that the equation has no solutions , which means that is never zero (indeed, for these -values, is always positive so that is always concave up). On the other hand, if , then , which guarantees that has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, changes sign, and therefore has infinitely many inflection points whenever .    To see why can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of , consider the equation , which implies that . Since , we know that . Once is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that , which means that for large , and cannot intersect. Moreover, for relatively small values of , the functions and can only intersect finitely many times since oscillates a finite number of times. This is why can only have a finite number of critical numbers, regardless of the value of .          In the graph below, is given in dark blue, while is shown in light blue.     Close inspection of the light blue graph reveals some subtle changes in concavity around . For values smaller than , it is very hard to visually detect any inflection points in .    Treating as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that . Again treating as a constant and differentiating, we find . We seek the values of for which at which changes sign. Setting and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek such that , or . Now, remember that is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that for all input values . If , then the equation has no solution. Hence, whenever , or , it follows that the equation has no solutions , which means that is never zero (indeed, for these -values, is always positive so that is always concave up). On the other hand, if , then , which guarantees that has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, changes sign, and therefore has infinitely many inflection points whenever .    To see why can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of , consider the equation , which implies that . Since , we know that . Once is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that , which means that for large , and cannot intersect. Moreover, for relatively small values of , the functions and can only intersect finitely many times since oscillates a finite number of times. This is why can only have a finite number of critical numbers, regardless of the value of .         Summary     The critical numbers of a continuous function are the values of for which or does not exist. These values are important because they identify horizontal tangent lines or corner points on the graph, which are the only possible locations at which a local maximum or local minimum can occur.    Given a differentiable function , whenever is positive, is increasing; whenever is negative, is decreasing. The first derivative test tells us that at any point where changes from increasing to decreasing, has a local maximum, while conversely at any point where changes from decreasing to increasing has a local minimum.    Given a twice differentiable function , if we have a horizontal tangent line at and is nonzero, the sign of tells us the concavity of and hence whether has a maximum or minimum at . In particular, if and , then is concave down at and has a local maximum there, while if and , then has a local minimum at . If and , then the second derivative does not tell us whether has a local extreme at or not.       Finding critical points and inflection points   Use a graph below of to estimate the -values of any critical points and inflection points of .   critical points (enter as a comma-separated list):   inflection points (enter as a comma-separated list):   Next, use derivatives to find the -values of any critical points and inflection points exactly.  critical points (enter as a comma-separated list):   inflection points (enter as a comma-separated list):                        SOLUTION  From the graph, we see that appears to have one critical point, at , and two inflection points, one between 0 and 1 and the other between 0 and -1.  To find the critical points, we set . Since , there is one solution, . The only critical point is at .  To find the inflection points, we find and determine where it is zero. For this to be zero, we must have , or . There are exactly two inflection points, at and .       Finding inflection points   Find the inflection points of . (Give your answers as a comma separated list, e.g., 3,-2 .)  inflection points =        SOLUTION  We find inflection points by determining where changes sign. , so . So we see that changes sign at and .       Matching graphs of   The following shows graphs of three functions, A (in black), B (in blue), and C (in green). If these are the graphs of three functions , , and , identify which is which.   (Click on the graph to get a larger version.)  (For each enter A, B or C).   ;  ;     A    B    C   SOLUTION  To determine which graphed function is the the derivative of another, we use the fact that the derivative is zero where the original function has a maximum or minimum. We note that C has zeros where B has a maximum or minimum, so it could be the derivative, so we can have . In addition, B has zeros where A has a maximum or minimum, so that it is possible that .  To confirm this, we compare intervals where B is increasing and decreasing and verify that these are where C is positive and negative, respectively, and similarly compare A and B.  This gives us that , , and .          This problem concerns a function about which the following information is known:    is a differentiable function defined at every real number           has its graph given at center in Figure       At center, a graph of ; at left, axes for plotting ; at right, axes for plotting .       Construct a first derivative sign chart for . Clearly identify all critical numbers of , where is increasing and decreasing, and where has local extrema.    On the right-hand axes, sketch an approximate graph of .    Construct a second derivative sign chart for . Clearly identify where is concave up and concave down, as well as all inflection points.    On the left-hand axes, sketch a possible graph of .          is positive for and for ; is negative for all . has a local minimum at .    A possible graph of is shown at right in the figure.     is negative for ; is positive everywhere else; has points of inflection at and .    A possible graph of is shown at left in the figure.            From the given graph of , the first derivative sign chart for shows that has critical numbers at and that is positive for and for , while being negative for all . Hence is increasing for and for , and decreasing for . It follows by the first derivative test that has a local minimum at because changes from decreasing to increasing there.    Based on where has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of , we can see that at and at , and that between these points, is negative because is decreasing, while is positive everywhere else since is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of is shown at right in the following figure.    From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for . In particular, we saw that at and at , and that between these points, is negative, while is positive everywhere else. This shows that is concave down for while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that has points of inflection at both and .    Now that we know where is increasing and decreasing as well as where is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that , we can sketch an approximate graph of . Note that we also know has a horizontal tangent line at while being increasing on either side of , and earlier we established that has a local minimum at . After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through , we arrive at the graph shown at left below.          Suppose that is a differentiable function and . In addition, suppose that on and it is known that is positive.   Does have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at ? Why?    Suppose that exists for every such that . Reasoning graphically, describe the behavior of for -values near .    Besides being a critical number of , what is special about the value in terms of the behavior of the graph of ?         Neither.     ; is negative for and positive for .     has a point of inflection at .          has neither a local maximum nor local minimum at because does not change sign at .    Because and is positive for and for , it must be that is decreasing for and is increasing for . Since changes from decreasing to increasing at , it follows that has a local minimum at and thus . In addition, must change sign from negative to positive at . In particular, is negative for and positive for .     has a horizontal tangent line at , is increasing before and decreasing after , and concave down before and concave up after , and thus has a point of inflection at .       Suppose that is a differentiable function whose first derivative is given by the graph in Figure .      How many real number solutions can the equation have? Why?    If has two distinct real solutions, what can you say about the signs of the two solutions? Why?    Assume that , as appears to be indicated in Figure . How will the graph of appear as ? Why?    Describe the concavity of as fully as you can from the provided information.      The graph of .          can have no, one, or two real zeros.       One root is negative and the other positive.     will look like a line with slope .     is concave up everywhere; is almost linear for large values of .

How can we construct first and second derivative sign charts of functions that depend on one or more parameters while allowing those parameters to remain arbitrary constants?      Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations, say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases. Think about the Pythagorean Theorem: it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle, but rather a fact about every right triangle. In the next part of our studies, we use calculus to make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more parameters. People who use applied mathematics, such as engineers and economists, often encounter the same types of functions where only small changes to certain constants occur. These constants are called parameters .   The graph of based on parameters , , , and .    You are already familiar with certain families of functions. For example, is a stretched and shifted version of the sine function with amplitude , period , phase shift , and vertical shift . We know that affects the size of the oscillation, the rapidity of oscillation, and where the oscillation starts, as shown in Figure , while affects the vertical positioning of the graph.  As another example, every function of the form is a line with slope and -intercept . The value of affects the line's steepness, and the value of situates the line vertically on the coordinate axes. These two parameters describe all possible non-vertical lines.  For other less familiar families of functions, we can use calculus to discover where key behavior occurs: where members of the family are increasing or decreasing, concave up or concave down, where relative extremes occur, and more, all in terms of the parameters involved. To get started, we revisit a common collection of functions to see how calculus confirms things we already know.   Let , , and be arbitrary real numbers with , and let be the function given by the rule .   What familiar type of function is ? What information do you know about just by looking at its form? (Think about the roles of , , and .)    Next we use some calculus to develop familiar ideas from a different perspective. To start, treat , , and as constants and compute .    Find all critical numbers of . (These will depend on at least one of , , and .)    Assume that . Construct a first derivative sign chart for .    Based on the information you've found above, classify the critical values of as maxima or minima.        Describing families of functions in terms of parameters  Our goal is to describe the key characteristics of the overall behavior of each member of a family of functions in terms of its parameters. By finding the first and second derivatives and constructing sign charts (each of which may depend on one or more of the parameters), we can often make broad conclusions about how each member of the family will appear.    Consider the two-parameter family of functions given by , where and are positive real numbers. Fully describe the behavior of a typical member of the family in terms of and , including the location of all critical numbers, where is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down, and the long term behavior of .    We begin by computing . By the product rule, . By applying the chain rule and constant multiple rule, we find that .  To find the critical numbers of , we solve the equation . By factoring , we find .  Since we are given that and we know that for all values of , the only way this equation can hold is when . Solving for , we find , and this is therefore the only critical number of .  We construct the first derivative sign chart for that is shown in Figure .   The first derivative sign chart for .    Because the factor is always positive, the sign of depends on the linear factor , which is positive for and negative for . Hence we can not only conclude that is always increasing for and decreasing for , but also that has a global maximum at and no local minimum.  We turn next to analyzing the concavity of . With , we differentiate to find that .  Combining like terms and factoring, we now have .   The second derivative sign chart for .    We observe that is always positive, and thus the sign of depends on the sign of , which is zero when . Since is positive, the value of is negative for and positive for . The sign chart for is shown in Figure . Thus, is concave down for all and concave up for all .  Finally, we analyze the long term behavior of by considering two limits. First, we note that .  This limit has indeterminate form , so we apply L'Hôpital's Rule and find that . In the other direction, , because and as . Hence, as we move left on its graph, decreases without bound, while as we move to the right, .  All of this information now helps us produce the graph of a typical member of this family of functions without using a graphing utility (and without choosing particular values for and ), as shown in Figure .   The graph of .    Note that the value of controls the horizontal location of the global maximum and the inflection point, as neither depends on . The value of affects the vertical stretch of the graph. For example, the global maximum occurs at the point , so the larger the value of , the greater the value of the global maximum.    The work we've completed in Example can often be replicated for other families of functions that depend on parameters. Normally we are most interested in determining all critical numbers, a first derivative sign chart, a second derivative sign chart, and the limit of the function as . Throughout, we prefer to work with the parameters as arbitrary constants. In addition, we can experiment with some particular values of the parameters present to reduce the algebraic complexity of our work. The following activities offer several key examples where we see that the values of the parameters substantially affect the behavior of individual functions within a given family.    Consider the family of functions defined by , where is an arbitrary constant.   Find and determine the critical numbers of . How many critical numbers does have?    Construct a first derivative sign chart for . What can you say about the overall behavior of if the constant is positive? Why? What if the constant is negative? In each case, describe the relative extremes of .    Find and construct a second derivative sign chart for . What does this tell you about the concavity of ? What role does play in determining the concavity of ?    Without using a graphing utility, sketch and label typical graphs of for the cases where and . Label all inflection points and local extrema.    Finally, use a graphing utility to test your observations above by entering and plotting the function for at least four different values of . Write several sentences to describe your overall conclusions about how the behavior of depends on .          When solving , think about two possible cases: when and when .    Remember that any quadratic function can be zero at most two times. How does the graph of look?    Don't forget that .    Think about how a typical cubic polynomial's graph behaves.           has two critical numbers ( ) whenever and no critical numbers when .    When , is always increasing and has no relative extreme values. When , has a relative maximum at and a relative minimum at .     is CCD for and is CCU for , making an inflection point.               We first note that , so to find critical numbers we set and solve for . This leads to the equation , which implies . If , then the solutions to this equation are ; if , then the equation has no solution. Hence, has two critical numbers ( ) whenever and no critical numbers when .    For the case when , we observe that is positive for every value of , and thus is always increasing and has no relative extreme values. (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart, and is always positive.) For the case when , we observe that is a concave up parabola with zeros at and . It follows that for , (so is increasing); for , (so is decreasing); and for , (so is again increasing). In this situation, we see that has a relative maximum at and a relative minimum at .    Since and is constant, it follows that . Note that when and that for and for . Hence is CCD for and is CCU for , making an inflection point.    Below, we show the two possible situations. At left, for the case when and is always increasing with an inflection point at , and at right for when and has a relative maximum at and a relative minimum at , again with an inflection point at . Note, too, that has its -intercepts at .            Consider the two-parameter family of functions of the form , where and are positive real numbers.   Find the first derivative and the critical numbers of . Use these to construct a first derivative sign chart and determine for which values of the function is increasing and decreasing.    Find the second derivative and build a second derivative sign chart. For which values of is a function in this family concave up? concave down?    What is the value of ? ?    How does changing the value of affect the shape of the curve?    Without using a graphing utility, sketch the graph of a typical member of this family. Write several sentences to describe the overall behavior of a typical function and how this behavior depends on and .          Expand to write before differentiating.    Remember that is never zero and always positive, regardless of the value of .    Recall that as and as .    Consider how affects the value of .    Use your work in (a)-(d).           is an always increasing function.     is always concave down.     , and .    If is large and is close to zero, is relatively large near , and the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as increases. If is small, the graph is less steep near and its slope goes to zero less quickly as increases.               Since , we have by the constant multiple and chain rules that . Since and are positive constants and for all , we see that is never zero (nor undefined), and indeed for all . Hence is an always increasing function.    Because , we have that . As with , we recognize that , , and are always positive, and thus for all values of , making always concave down.    As , . Thus, . This shows that has a horizontal asymptote at as we move rightward on its graph. As , . Thus, .    Noting that , we see that if we consider different values of , the slope of the graph changes. If is large and is close to zero, (since ), so is relatively large near . At the same time, for large , approaches zero quickly as increases, so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as increases. If is small, the graph is less steep near and its slope goes to zero less quickly as increases.    Observing that and , along with the facts that is always increasing and always concave down, we see that a typical member of this family looks like the following graph.            Let , where , , and are all positive real numbers.   Observe that we can equivalently write . Find and explain why has no critical numbers. Is always increasing or always decreasing? Why?    Given the fact that , find all values of such that and hence construct a second derivative sign chart. For which values of is a function in this family concave up? concave down?    What is the value of ? ?    Find the value of at the inflection point found in (b).    Without using a graphing utility, sketch the graph of a typical member of this family. Write several sentences to describe the overall behavior of a typical function and how this behavior depends on , , and number.    Explain why it is reasonable to think that the function models the growth of a population over time in a setting where the largest possible population the surrounding environment can support is .          Use the chain rule, treating , , and as constants.    Note that the only way is if .    Remember that as and as .    Don't forget that for all .    Think about horizontal asymptotes, where is increasing and decreasing, and concavity.           is an always increasing function.     is concave up for all and concave up for all other values of .     , and .    The inflection point on the graph of is .               By the chain rule and treating , , and as constants, we find that . Since , , and are all positive and for all values of , it is apparent that is never zero, and indeed is positive for every value of . Thus, is an always increasing function.    Given that , the only way is if . Solving for , we first write . Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, , so that is the only value of for which . Now, observe that since as , the quantity will be positive to the left of where it is zero and negative to the right of where it is zero. Since this is the only term in that can change sign, it follows that for and for , making concave up to the left of the noted inflection point and concave down thereafter.    Recalling that as , we observe that , so has a horizontal asymptote of as . On the other hand, since as , this causes the denominator of to grow without bound (while the numerator remains constant), and therefore , which means has a horizontal asymptote of as .    From (b), we know that is the location of the inflection point of . Evaluating the function at this point, we find that . Thus, the inflection point on the graph of is located at .    We have shown that is an always increasing function that has horizontal asymptotes at and , as well as an inflection point at , which we note lies vertically halfway between the asymptotes. In addition, we see that . The combination of all of this information shows us that a typical graph in this family of functions is given by the following figure.            Summary     Given a family of functions that depends on one or more parameters, by investigating how critical numbers and locations where the second derivative is zero depend on the values of these parameters, we can often accurately describe the shape of the function in terms of the parameters.    In particular, just as we can created first and second derivative sign charts for a single function, we often can do so for entire families of functions where critical numbers and possible inflection points depend on arbitrary constants. These sign charts then reveal where members of the family are increasing or decreasing, concave up or concave down, and help us to identify relative extremes and inflection points.       Drug dosage with a parameter   For some positive constant , a patient's temperature change, , due to a dose, , of a drug is given by  What dosage maximizes the temperature change?    The sensitivity of the body to the drug is defined as . What dosage maximizes sensitivity?               SOLUTION  We have and so  Since, by this formula, is zero when or , negative when , and positive when , we have (by the first derivative test) that the temperature change is maximized when .  The sensitivity is ; its derivative is , which is zero if , negative if , and positive if . Thus by the first derivative test the sensitivity is maximized at .       Using the graph of   The figure below gives the behavior of the derivative of on .   Graph of ( not  )  (Click on the graph to get a larger version.)  Sketch a graph of and use your sketch to answer the following questions.  A. Where does the graph of have inflection points?

Enter infinity for , the interval [1,1] to indicate a single point).  How is the value of related to the value of ?     (Enter the appropriate mathematical equality or inequality, , , , etc.)                        <   SOLUTION  Because the graph of is negative for all , we know that the graph of must always be decreasing there. The derivative appears to be zero at , so the graph of must start out flat at , and then decreases more and more rapidly as it approaches . After the it decreases less rapidly, finally flattening out entirely as we get to .  A. The graph has an inflection point at , where the slope changes from negative and decreasing to negative and increasing.  B. The function has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .  C. Since the function is decreasing over the interval , we know that must be less than , and so must be in the interval . (We note that it appears that the magnitude of the derivative is also less than one for the entire domain that we are considering, so we can actually give a smaller interval for the possible values of ; any interval between and is reasonable.)  D. Again, since the function is decreasing over the interval , we know that .          Consider the one-parameter family of functions given by , where .   Sketch a plot of a typical member of the family, using the fact that each is a cubic polynomial with a repeated zero at and another zero at .    Find all critical numbers of .    Compute and find all values for which . Hence construct a second derivative sign chart for .    Describe how the location of the critical numbers and the inflection point of change as changes. That is, if the value of is increased, what happens to the critical numbers and inflection point?               and .     ; changes sign from negative to positive at .    As we increase the value of , both the location of the critical number and the inflection point move to the right along with .         Writing , we see that at and . Further, since for all , we note that whenever and for all . A typical such function is plotted below.       To find the critical numbers of , we first compute . Treating as constant, we have . Thus, setting , we find that and thus and are the critical numbers of .    Observe that and thus implies that . Since is linear with positive slope, we see that changes sign from negative to positive at , and thus is concave down for and concave up for and is the only inflection point of .    There is always a critical number of at . But the other critical number at and the inflection point at both obviously depend directly on : as we increase the value of , both the location of the critical number and the inflection point move to the right along with .       Let be a one-parameter family of functions where .   Explain why has a vertical asymptote at .    Determine and .    Compute and find all critical numbers of .    Construct a first derivative sign chart for and determine whether each critical number leads to a local minimum, local maximum, or neither for the function .    Sketch a typical member of this family of functions with important behaviors clearly labeled.          is a vertical asymptote because and .     ; .    The only critical number for is .    When , ; when , ; has a local maximum at .              The value of the numerator at is , while the value of the denominator is at . Thus, and . This makes the line a vertical asymptote for .    We can write as and thus see the denominator increases without bound as . Therefore, . This makes the line a horizontal asymptote for . As , increases without bound, while decreases without bound. Thus, has an indeterminate form as . Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us .    Using , the quotient and product rules along with algebraic simplification show that . The function has critical points in its domain where or doesn't exist. Note that is undefined at , but is not in the domain of mq. Thus, the only critical points of occur when . The only way the fraction can be is if the numerator is . Since when , the only critical number for is .    The values of the exponential function and the quadratic are positive for , so the sign of depends entirely on the sign of . When we see that and when we have . Thus, is increasing on and is decreasing on , so it follows that is a relative maximum value. This value is a local maximum, since the value of can be made as large as we like as shown in part (b).    We've shown that a typical member of the family of functions given by has a vertical asymptote at and a critical number at which a local maximum occurs one unit to the left of at . A typical such graph is shown below. Note how is increasing and decreasing according to our earlier work in (d).          Let , where is any real number and is a positive real number.   Compute and hence find all critical numbers of .    Construct a first derivative sign chart for and classify each critical number of the function as a local minimum, local maximum, or neither.    It can be shown that is given by the formula . Find all values of for which .    Determine and .    Construct a labeled graph of a typical function that clearly shows how important points on the graph of depend on and .          .     is increasing for and decreasing for , with a local maximum at .     .     .              Treating and as constants, by the chain rule, Note that is defined for every value of , thus the only critical numbers occur where . Since raised to any power is never zero, the only way that is for , which implies that . Thus, is the only critical number of .    As we noted in (a), is the only critical number of . More over, since to any power is always positive, the sign of depends entirely on the expression . This linear function of has negative slope, and thus is positive for and negative for , and thus is positive for and negative for . Therefore, is increasing for and decreasing for , with a local maximum at .    From the given formula for and our knowledge that to any power is positive, the only way is for , which implies that , and therefore , or . These are the two values for which .    As , we know that the quadratic function must decrease without bound because the quadratic function opens down. Thus, the power to which we are raising in the formula for is decreasing without bound, which means that must approach since raising to more and more negative numbers drives the result to . Thus, .    We've shown that has a single critical number at and two potential points of inflection at , as well as that as . All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.          "

  "body": " Global Optimization     What are the differences between finding relative extreme values and global extreme values of a function?    How is the process of finding the global maximum or minimum of a function over the function's entire domain different from determining the global maximum or minimum on a restricted domain?    For a function that is guaranteed to have both a global maximum and global minimum on a closed, bounded interval, what are the possible points at which these extreme values occur?      We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down. This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph, as well as whether the function has relative extrema.  Remember the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum: there is a relative maximum of at if for all  near  , while there is a global maximum at if for all  in the domain of .   For instance, in Figure , we see a function that has a global maximum at and a relative maximum at , since is greater than for every value of , while is only greater than the value of for near . Since the function appears to decrease without bound, has no global minimum, though clearly has a relative minimum at .   A function with a global maximum, but no global minimum.     Our emphasis in this section is on finding the global extreme values of a function (if they exist), either over its entire domain or on some restricted portion.   Let .   Determine all of the critical numbers of .    Construct a first derivative sign chart for and thus determine all intervals on which is increasing or decreasing.    Does have a global maximum?

If so, why, and what is its value and where is the minimum attained? If not, explain why.        Global Optimization  In Figure and Preview Activity , we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum for on its entire domain. At other times, we might focus on some restriction of the domain.  For example, rather than considering for every value of , perhaps instead we are only interested in those for which , and we would like to know which values of in the interval produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of . We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function; now, by restricting the domain to an interval, it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider, as we see in the following activity. When limiting ourselves to a particular interval, we will often refer to the absolute maximum or minimum value, rather than the global maximum or minimum.    Let .   Find all critical numbers of that lie in the interval .    Use a graphing utility to construct the graph of on the interval .    From the graph, determine the -values at which the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of occur on the interval .    How do your answers change if we instead consider the interval ?    What if we instead consider the interval ?          Check that each critical number you find satisfies .     WolframAlpha is a great choice.    On the graph, look for the lowest and highest possible values of the function.    Ask yourself the same questions as (a)-(c), simply using the new interval.           .         On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .    On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .    On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .          Since , the critical numbers of are , both of which lie in the interval .    The figure shown below shows three related plots, each with the emphases on the interval provided in (c), (d), and (e).       On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .    On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .    On , has a global maximum at and a global minimum at .       In Activity , we saw how the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed, bounded interval , depend not only on the critical numbers of the function, but also on the values of and . These observations demonstrate several important facts that hold more generally. First, we state an important result called the Extreme Value Theorem.   The Extreme Value Theorem   extreme value theorem If is a continuous function on a closed interval , then attains both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum on .    The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that on any closed interval , a continuous function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum. The theorem does not tell us where these extreme values occur, but rather only that they must exist. As we saw in Activity , the only possible locations for relative extremes are at the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number.   Thus, we have the following approach to finding the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function on the interval :   find all critical numbers of that lie in the interval;    evaluate the function at each critical number in the interval and at each endpoint of the interval;    from among those function values, the smallest is the absolute minimum of on the interval, while the largest is the absolute maximum.        Find the exact absolute maximum and minimum of each function on the stated interval.    ,      ,      ,      ,      , ( )     , ,           After computing , factor to write the derivative as a product.    The sine and cosine functions have the same value at for any integer .    Upon finding , factor its numerator.    Remember that is never zero.    After differentiating, remove a factor of .    Compare part (d).          Absolute maximum: ; absolute minimum: .    Absolute maximum: ; absolute minimum: .    Absolute maximum: 9.8; absolute minimum: 8.    Absolute minimum 3; no absolute maximum.    Absolute minimum ; absolute maximum .    Absolute minimum ; no absolute maximum.          For , we know that . Therefore, the only critical number of is . Next, we compute , , and . Observe that                   Thus, on , the absolute maximum of is and the absolute minimum is .    Given , it follows , so implies that . The sine and cosine functions have the same value at for any integer . The only time this occurs in is for , and thus this is the only critical number of in the given interval. Now,                   Therefore, on , the absolute maximum of is and the absolute minimum is .    With , we have . Hence, the critical numbers of are and . Only the latter critical number lies in the interval , and thus we evaluate and find                   We now see that on the absolute maximum of is 9.8 and the absolute minimum is 8.    Here, we first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers, not a closed bounded interval. Hence, we need to think about the overall behavior of the function. First, since , by the chain rule we see that . Since is always positive (in particular, never zero), it follows that the only critical number of is . Furthermore, with , we see that for , , while for , . This tells us by the first derivative test that is decreasing for and increasing for , which tells us that has an absolute minimum at , and does not have an absolute maximum.    For on , where , we start by finding . By the product and chain rules, treating as a constant, we find . Factoring, it follows . Since is never zero, the only way for is if , which implies . Noting also that is defined for every real number , we have established that has a single critical number at .  Now we simply compute the value of at each endpoint and at the critical number and compare the outputs. We have , , and . The absolute minimum is , and the absolute maximum is the larger of and . That absolute maximum is , since .    The reasoning here is identical to that in (d), but instead of working with , we use arbitrary positive constants and to consider        The interval we choose has nearly the same influence on extreme values as the function under consideration. Consider, for instance, the function pictured in Figure .   A function considered on three different intervals.    In sequence, from left to right, the interval under consideration is changed from to to .  On the interval , there are two critical numbers, with the absolute minimum at one critical number and the absolute maximum at the right endpoint.  On the interval , both critical numbers are in the interval, with the absolute minimum and maximum at the two critical numbers.  On the interval , just one critical number lies in the interval, with the absolute maximum at one critical number and the absolute minimum at one endpoint.    Remember to consider only the critical numbers that lie within the interval.    Moving toward applications  We conclude this section with an example of an applied optimization problem. It highlights the role that a closed, bounded domain can play in finding absolute extrema.    A 20 cm piece of wire is cut into two pieces. One piece is used to form a square and the other to form an equilateral triangle. How should the wire be cut to maximize the total area enclosed by the square and triangle? to minimize the area?    We begin by sketching a picture that illustrates the situation. The variable in the problem is where we decide to cut the wire. We thus label the cut point at a distance from one end of the wire, and note that the remaining portion of the wire then has length    As shown in Figure , we see that the cm of wire that is used to form the equilateral triangle with three sides of length . For the remaining cm of wire, the square that results will have each side of length .   A 20 cm piece of wire cut into two pieces, one of which forms an equilateral triangle, the other which yields a square.     At this point, we note that there are obvious restrictions on : in particular, . In the extreme cases, all of the wire is being used to make just one figure. For instance, if , then all 20 cm of wire are used to make a square that is .  Now, our overall goal is to find the minimum and maximum areas that can be enclosed. Because the height of an equilateral triangle is times half the length of the base, the area of the triangle is . The area of the square is . Therefore, the total area function is .  Remember that we are considering this function only on the restricted domain .  Differentiating , we have .  When we set , we find that is the only critical number of in the interval .  Evaluating at the critical number and endpoints, we see that                    Thus, the absolute minimum occurs when and results in the minimum area of approximately square centimeters. The absolute maximum occurs when we invest all of the wire in the square (and none in the triangle), resulting in 25 square centimeters of area. These results are confirmed by a plot of on the interval , as shown in Figure .   A plot of the area function from Example .         A piece of cardboard that is (each measured in inches) is being made into a box without a top. To do so, squares are cut from each corner of the box and the remaining sides are folded up. If the box needs to be at least 1 inch deep and no more than 3 inches deep, what is the maximum possible volume of the box? what is the minimum volume? Justify your answers using calculus.   Draw a labeled diagram that shows the given information. What variable should we introduce to represent the choice we make in creating the box? Label the diagram appropriately with the variable, and write a sentence to state what the variable represents.    Determine a formula for the function (that depends on the variable in (a)) that tells us the volume of the box.    What is the domain of the function ? That is, what values of make sense for input? Are there additional restrictions provided in the problem?    Determine all critical numbers of the function .    Evaluate at each of the endpoints of the domain and at any critical numbers that lie in the domain.    What is the maximum possible volume of the box? the minimum?          Consider letting the length of one side of the removed squares be represented by .    Remember that the volume of a box is length width height.    Read the given information carefully and think about the picture.    Note that since is a cubic function, is quadratic.    Which critical numbers satisfy ?    Evaluate the function at appropriate points.                .     .     .                         Absolute maximum: 132.0382370; absolute minimum: 104.          We let represent the length of a side of the square that is cut from each corner, so that we have the following picture:       Because the box has dimensions , the volume of the box is given by .    Clearly the smallest can be is 0 and the largest can be is 5, since one side of the cardboard has length 10. But we're told in the problem to restrict the value of to , so this is the domain we use for , even though is defined for every real number .    Since , it follows that the critical numbers (where ) are .    Only the latter critical number is in the relevant domain of , and hence we consider                     Hence the absolute maximum possible volume of the box is 132.0382370 and occurs when , while the absolute minimum is 104, which occurs when .        Example and Activity illustrate standard steps that we undertake in almost every applied optimization problem: we draw a picture to demonstrate the situation, introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing, find a function that models the quantity to be optimized, and then decide on an appropriate domain for that function. Once that is done, we are in the familiar situation of finding the absolute minimum and maximum of a function over a particular domain, so we apply the calculus ideas that we have been studying to this point in Chapter .    Summary     To find relative extreme values of a function, we use a first derivative sign chart and classify all of the function's critical numbers. If instead we are interested in absolute extreme values, we first decide whether we are considering the entire domain of the function or a particular interval.    In the case of finding global extremes over the function's entire domain, we again use a first or second derivative sign chart. If we are working to find absolute extremes on a restricted interval, then we first identify all critical numbers of the function that lie in the interval.    For a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, the only possible points at which absolute extreme values occur are the critical numbers and the endpoints. Thus, we simply evaluate the function at each endpoint and each critical number in the interval, and compare the results to decide which is largest (the absolute maximum) and which is smallest (the absolute minimum).        Based on the given information about each function, decide whether the function has global maximum, a global minimum, neither, both, or that it is not possible to say without more information. Assume that each function is twice differentiable and defined for all real numbers, unless noted otherwise. In each case, write one sentence to explain your conclusion.    is a function such that for every .     is a function with two critical numbers and (where ), and for , for , and for .     is a function with two critical numbers and (where ), and for , for , and for . In addition, and .     is a function differentiable everywhere except at and for and for .         Not enough information is given.    Global minimum at .    Global minimum at ; global maximum at .    Not enough information is provided.         It's not possible to say without more information: for instance, the functions , , and are each always concave up, but only one of them has a global minimum. We can say for sure that by being always concave up, cannot have a global maximum, and it also cannot have both a global maximum and a global minimum. It might have a global minimum, or it might have neither.    By being twice differentiable, we know that any time is a critical number of . Thus, given the signs of on the stated intervals, is decreasing before and decreasing on , with a horizontal tangent line at . In addition, is increasing for . Thus, we know that has a global minimum at .    Since is always decreasing for , always increasing for , and always decreasing for , we know that has a local minimum at and a local maximum at . Moreover, these local extremes are both global extremes since as . In particular, since decreases to for and increases on , it follows that is the largest value of on , and that . Similarly, since decreases on and approaches as , and increases on , it must be the case that is the least value of on and that . Hence, is always negative on and is always positive on . From all of these observations, it follows that has a global minimum at and a global maximum at .    First, observe that is defined for all real numbers by assumption, so has some finite value. However, is not differentiable at and is concave up to the left of and concave down to the right of . This indicates that has a relative maximum at . Not enough information is provided, however, to determine if this relative maximum is a global maximum, nor if happens to have a global minimum at some other point.       For each family of functions that depends on one or more parameters, determine the function's absolute maximum and absolute minimum on the given interval.    , ( )     , ( )     , ( )     , ( )         Absolute maximum ; absolute minimum .    Absolute max ; absolute min .    Absolute minimum ; absolute maximum .    Absolute max ; absolute min .         Given on , we first find the critical number(s) of that lie in . Since , we know has critical numbers at . The negative critical number lies outside the interval, while the positive one lies within the interval since . Evaluating at the endpoints and the critical number within the interval, we find that , , and . Hence, the absolute maximum of on is and the absolute minimum is .    Given on , we first find the critical numbers of that lie in the given interval. Note that by the product rule, . Factoring, , and thus the only critical number of occurs where . Note that since , and thus the critical number lies within the interval.  Evaluating at the endpoints and the critical number, we find                 The absolute max of is therefore and the absolute min is .    For on , we first note that . Since and are both positive and so is for every value of , we see that for every value of . Because is always increasing (specifically on ), has its absolute minimum at the left endpoint ( ) and its absolute maximum at the right endpoint ( ).    Finally, for on , we know , and when for some integer , so . These -values are the critical numbers of . Note that when , the corresponding critical numbers are Comparing the values of , , and to and , we see that only lies in the given interval , and thus is the only critical number at which we need to evaluate .  Evaluating at the endpoints and relevant critical number, we find:    ;     ; and     .   Hence the absolute max of on is and the absolute min of is .       For each of the functions described below (each continuous on ), state the location of the function's absolute maximum and absolute minimum on the interval , or say there is not enough information provided to make a conclusion. Assume that any critical numbers mentioned in the problem statement represent all of the critical numbers the function has in . In each case, write one sentence to explain your answer.    for all in      has a critical number at such that and for and for      and for all in      , , and for the critical number such that , for and for          Global maximum at ; global minimum at .    Global maximum at ; global minimum at either or .    Global minimum at and ; global maximum somewhere in .    Global minimum at ; global maximum value at .         The fact that for all in means that cannot increase in this interval. So either is constant or decreases somewhere in this interval. We can conclude that the global maximum value of occurs at and the global minimum value at .    The information we are given shows that is increasing on and decreasing on . So has a global maximum value at . We know that must have a global minimum at either or .

  "body": " Applied Optimization     In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought, how do we develop a function that models the situation and use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?      Near the conclusion of Section , we considered two optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem. In Example , we sought to use a single piece of wire to build an equilateral triangle and square in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed. In the subsequent Activity , we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.  In neither of these problems was a function to optimize explicitly provided. Rather, we first tried to understand the problem by drawing a figure and introducing variables, and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity to be optimized. Once the function was established, we then considered what domain was appropriate. At that point, we were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.  Throughout what follows in the current section, the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems. Initially, some substantial guidance is provided, with the problems progressing to require greater independence as we move along.   According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by girth we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. What is the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail? What are the dimensions of the package of largest volume?     Let represent the length of one side of the square end and the length of the longer side. Label these quantities appropriately on the image shown in Figure .   A rectangular parcel with a square end.      What is the quantity to be optimized in this problem? Find a formula for this quantity in terms of and .    The problem statement tells us that the parcel's girth plus length may not exceed 108 inches. In order to maximize volume, we assume that we will actually need the girth plus length to equal 108 inches. What equation does this produce involving and ?    Solve the equation you found in (c) for one of or (whichever is easier).    Now use your work in (b) and (d) to determine a formula for the volume of the parcel so that this formula is a function of a single variable.    Over what domain should we consider this function? Note that both and must be positive; how does the constraint that girth plus length is 108 inches produce intervals of possible values for and ?    Find the absolute maximum of the volume of the parcel on the domain you established in (f) and hence also determine the dimensions of the box of greatest volume. Justify that you've found the maximum using calculus.        More applied optimization problems  Many of the steps in Preview Activity are ones that we will execute in any applied optimization problem. We briefly summarize those here to provide an overview of our approach in subsequent questions.      Draw a picture and introduce variables. It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables. Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step. Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation. A nice example of this can be seen in this applet , where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.    Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities. Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought, and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.    Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula. For example, in Preview Activity , we initially found that , but then the additional relationship that (girth plus length equals 108 inches) allows us to relate and and thus observe equivalently that . Substituting for in the volume equation yields , and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable .    Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized. Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on. Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.    Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and\/or minimum of the quantity being optimized. This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first. Then, depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers (for a closed, bounded interval), using ideas we've studied so far in Chapter .    Finally, we make certain we have answered the question: does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity, or the values of the variables that produce the maximum? That is, finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.        A soup can in the shape of a right circular cylinder is to be made from two materials. The material for the side of the can costs $0.015 per square inch and the material for the lids costs $ per square inch. Suppose that we desire to construct a can that has a volume of 16 cubic inches. What dimensions minimize the cost of the can?   Draw a picture of the can and label its dimensions with appropriate variables.    Use your variables to determine expressions for the volume, surface area, and cost of the can.    Determine the total cost function as a function of a single variable. What is the domain on which you should consider this function?    Find the absolute minimum cost and the dimensions that produce this value.          Note that both the radius and the height of the can are variable.    Remember that volume is the area of the base times the height, while surface are can be thought of in terms of the area of the two lids, plus the area of the side of the can.    Use the fact that to write one of the variables in terms of the other to get the cost as a function of a single variable.    Differentiate the total cost function and find its critical number(s) first.          Let the can have radius and height .     ; ; .     , .     ; ; minimum cost .          We let be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and be its height.    Volume is the area of the base times the height, so . Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the side, the latter of which is a rectangle with height and width the perimeter of the base. Hence, . Finally, the total cost is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is .    Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches, we know that . Solving for , . Substituting this expression for in the formula for total cost, we now have that . With , we note that the only constraint on is that , hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize .    Noting that , we set and solve for to find that , so that , from which it follows that is the only critical number of . At this point, we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that has an absolute minimum at . We choose to use the second derivative test; note that , which is always positive for , hence is always concave up on the relevant domain ( ), which makes where the absolute minimum of occurs. In addition, we note that since , the corresponding value is , and the overall minimum cost is .       Familiarity with common geometric formulas is particularly helpful in problems such as the one in Activity . Sometimes those involve perimeter, area, volume, or surface area. At other times, the constraints of a problem introduce right triangles (where the Pythagorean Theorem applies) or other functions whose formulas provide relationships among the variables.    A hiker starting at a point on a straight road walks east towards point , which is on the road and 3 kilometers from point .   Two kilometers due north of point is a cabin. The hiker will walk down the road for a while, at a pace of 8 kilometers per hour. At some point between and , the hiker leaves the road and makes a straight line towards the cabin through the woods, hiking at a pace of 3 kph, as pictured in Figure . In order to minimize the time to go from to to the cabin, where should the hiker turn into the forest?   A hiker walks from to to the cabin, as pictured.       Let be the distance from to . What is then the distance from to in terms of ? How about the distance from to the cabin? How does time depend on distance and rate?    The absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is hours, which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from to and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.    We begin by letting be the distance from to . Since it is 3 km from to , the distance from to is . Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from to the cabin is .  Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of . Because distance equals rate times time, time is thus distance divided by rate. Along the road, the hiker's distance is km and her rate is km\/hr, thus her time on the road, is .  Once she enters the woods, her rate drops to km\/hr and travels a distance of km, making her time in the woods, , given by .  Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function .  Because the only values of that make sense to use are (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip), we use this domain for and now seek the absolute minimum of on . First, we find that .  Setting and solving for , we have , so . Squaring both sides, . Hence, , so . (We don't consider the critical number because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of .)  Finally, we evaluate at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints. Doing so, we find , , and , and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is hours, which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from to and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.    In more geometric problems, we often use curves or functions to provide natural constraints. For instance, we could investigate which isosceles triangle that circumscribes a unit circle has the smallest area, which you can explore for yourself in this applet . Or similarly, for a region bounded by a parabola, we might seek the rectangle of largest area that fits beneath the curve, as shown in this applet . The next activity is similar to the latter problem.    Consider the region in the - plane that is bounded by the -axis and the function . Construct a rectangle whose base lies on the -axis and is centered at the origin, and whose sides extend vertically until they intersect the curve . Which such rectangle has the maximum possible area? Which such rectangle has the greatest perimeter? Which has the greatest combined perimeter and area? (Challenge: answer the same questions in terms of positive parameters and for the function .)    Let represent half the width of the rectangle's base. How does the rectangle's height depend on ?    Maximum area: . Maximum perimeter: . At the absolute maximum of combined perimeter and area occurs.    Letting represent half the width of the rectangle's base, it follows that the rectangle's height is . Hence the area of the rectangle is .  Based on the region, the only possible values of are for ; moreover, it is evident that for either or , the area of the corresponding rectangle is zero, which can't be where the maximum occurs. Differentiating, , so we find the critical number of by solving , which yields , which results in the maximum possible area of square units.  To maximize perimeter, we note that the rectangle's perimeter is .  It is straightforward to show that the only critical number of the quadratic function occurs when and that the corresponding absolute maximum value is .  Finally, to consider combined area and perimeter, examine the function on the interval . You should find that the only relevant critical number is and that the absolute maximum of occurs at that value.      A trough is being constructed by bending a (measured in feet) rectangular piece of sheet metal.   Two symmetric folds 2 feet apart will be made parallel to the longest side of the rectangle so that the trough has cross-sections in the shape of a trapezoid, as pictured in Figure . At what angle should the folds be made to produce the trough of maximum volume?   A cross-section of the trough formed by folding to an angle of .       Drop altitudes from the top of the trough to the base of length 2. In the two triangles that are formed, what are the lengths of the legs in terms of ?     is the absolute maximum cross-sectional area, which leads to the absolute maximum volume.    Once we choose the angle , the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined, and each has a horizontal leg of length and a vertical leg of length . Thus, the sum of the areas of the two triangles is , and the area of the rectangle between them is . Hence, the area of the trapezoidal cross-section is . Because the length of the trough is constant, the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area. Note, too, that the domain for is .  Differentiating, we find that .  Using the identity , it follows that .  This most recent equation is quadratic in , so letting , we can start to solve the equation by solving . Doing so, we find that , so only will be a potential value of the cosine function from an angle that lies in the interval . Now, recalling that , to find the critical number , we solve , which implies radians, or .  Finally, to confirm that has an absolute maximum at , we consider this value as well as the endpoints of , and evaluate to find that , , and , which is the absolute maximum possible cross-sectional area.      Summary     While there is no single algorithm that works in every situation where optimization is used, in most of the problems we consider, the following steps are helpful: draw a picture and introduce variables; identify the quantity to be optimized and find relationships among the variables; determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized; use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and\/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.       Maximizing the volume of a box   An open box is to be made out of a 10-inch by 18-inch piece of cardboard by cutting out squares of equal size from the four corners and bending up the sides. Find the dimensions of the resulting box that has the largest volume.  Dimensions of the bottom of the box: x  Height of the box:                 Minimizing the cost of a container   A rectangular storage container with an open top is to have a volume of 26 cubic meters. The length of its base is twice the width. Material for the base costs 11 dollars per square meter. Material for the sides costs 9 dollars per square meter. Find the cost of materials for the cheapest such container.  Total cost = (Round to the nearest penny and include monetary units. For example, if your answer is 1.095, enter $1.10 including the dollar sign and second decimal place.)        SOLUTION  Let and denote the width of the base and the height of the container, respectively.  Since the length of the base is twice the width, the volume of the container is so The sides have total area , while the base has area , so the cost is Substuting the expression for gives   is the critical number. There is an absolute minimum at this critical number since for and for .  The total minimum cost is       Maximizing area contained by a fence   An ostrich farmer wants to enclose a rectangular area and then divide it into six pens with fencing parallel to one side of the rectangle (see the figure below). There are 620 feet of fencing available to complete the job. What is the largest possible total area of the six pens?   Largest area = (include help (units) )            Minimizing the area of a poster   The top and bottom margins of a poster are 8 cm and the side margins are each 6 cm. If the area of printed material on the poster is fixed at 388 square centimeters, find the dimensions of the poster with the smallest area.   Width = (include help (units) )  Height = (include help (units) )                 Maximizing the area of a rectangle   A rectangle is inscribed with its base on the -axis and its upper corners on the parabola . What are the dimensions of such a rectangle with the greatest possible area?  Width =  Height =                  A rectangular box with a square bottom and closed top is to be made from two materials. The material for the sides costs $1.50 per square foot and the material for the top and bottom costs $3.00 per square foot. If you are willing to spend $15 on the box, what is the largest volume it can contain? Justify your answer completely using calculus.   The absolute maximum volume is cubic feet.   Let be the length of one side of the square bottom and the height of one of the sides. We first note that the volume, , of the box is , and the surface area of the box is , since there are two square sides (bottom and top) of area and four identical sides of area . Since the material for the top and bottom costs $3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs $1.50 per square foot, it follows that the total cost of a box with surface area is .  We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend $15. This cost constraint implies that , which allows us to express as a function of by solving for . Doing so, we see that , so . Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume, , of the box as a function of the single variable . Subsituting the expression for , we have . Note particularly that in order to have a box, we require that both and . The latter condition along with the fact that shows that we need , and thus , so . Hence we are considering on the domain .  It is apparent that the box vanishes (and its volume tends to zero) as either or , and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number. Differentiating , we find that . Solving to find all critical numbers of in the domain, we see that , and thus , so only is a critical number that lies in . Noting that the absolute minimum volume occurs at each endpoint, it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is cubic feet.    A farmer wants to start raising cows, horses, goats, and sheep, and desires to have a rectangular pasture for the animals to graze in. However, no two different kinds of animals can graze together. In order to minimize the amount of fencing she will need, she has decided to enclose a large rectangular area and then divide it into four equally sized pens by adding three segments of fence inside the large rectangle that are parallel to two existing sides. She has decided to purchase 7500 ft of fencing. What is the maximum possible area that each of the four pens will enclose?   The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is 351562.5 square feet.   The farmer will fence a rectangular area whose length and width are unknown. The total area of the rectangular area is composed of 4 equal area rectangles. There are two ways to do this as shown in the figure below (though only the one on the left explicitly follows the way the problem is framed).     We want to maximize the area of each subrectangular region, which is the same as maximizing the total area of the entire rectangular region. Since has two variables, we can't yet directly apply calculus techniques to it. We use the information about the amount of fencing to relate and in order to write in terms of just one variable.  In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is . We assume that all of the feet of fencing will be used, so . Solving for , . Substituting this expression for into the area formula allows us to write in terms of alone: . To enclose any area, we of course must have and , and since , it follows that we need to have so . To find the maximum value of on this domain, we find the critical numbers of . Since , we see that when and only when . For , we see that and for we have . So square feet is the absolute maximum value of . The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or square feet.  In the case of the fencing option on the right in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is . We assume that all of the feet of fencing will be used, so . Solving for and substituting into , we find and . To enclose any area, we of course must have and , and since , it follows that we need to have . To find the maximum value of on this domain, we find the critical numbers of . Since , we see that when and only when . For , we see that and for we have . So square feet is the absolute maximum value of . The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or square feet.  So the maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is 390625 square feet, and we see that the righthand alternative is even more optimal than the left one.    Two vertical poles of heights 60 ft and 80 ft stand on level ground, with their bases 100 ft apart. A cable that is stretched from the top of one pole to some point on the ground between the poles, and then to the top of the other pole. What is the minimum possible length of cable required? Justify your answer completely using calculus.    feet of cable.   We start by constructing a careful diagram of the overall situation. Let be the distance from the first pole to the second pole where the cable touches the ground, and let be the length of the cable from the top of the first tower to the ground, and the length of cable from the ground to the top of the second tower, as pictured in the following figure. Note that we have included the given heights of the towers and the distance between them.     The total amount of cable, , used (which we wish to minimize) is given by . We can use the geometry of the situation to write both and in terms of . In the first right triangle, by the Pythagorean Theorem we know that , and thus . In the second right triangle, note that the horizontal leg of the triangle has length , and thus , so . It follows that with , . It is also apparent from the given situation that the relevant domain for is . Given that we want to minimize on this closed interval, it remains to find any critical numbers of .  We note by the chain rule that We use technology to solve the equation and find that it has a single solution in the interval : .  To find the absolute minimum of on the relevant domain, we evaluate at the endpoints and the only critical number. Doing so, we fine , , and . Hence the least amount of cable we can use is approximately feet and is accomplished by anchoring the cable about feet from the first tower.    A company is designing propane tanks that are cylindrical with hemispherical ends. Assume that the company wants tanks that will hold 1000 cubic feet of gas, and that the ends are more expensive to make, costing $5 per square foot, while the cylindrical barrel between the ends costs $2 per square foot. Use calculus to determine the minimum cost to construct such a tank.   The minimum cost is $1165.70.   We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be with the radius of the cylinder given by . It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also . We first identify formulas for both the volume and surface area of the tank by looking at the cylindrical and hemispherical pieces.  The cylindrical part of the tank has volume , and the surface area of its sides is (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle). The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere, and the volume of a sphere is , while the surface area of a sphere is .  The overall volume of the tank is therefore , and its total surface area is . Moreover, taking into account the different costs of material for the cylindrical sides and hemispherical ends, we find that the total cost of the tank is .  Our goal is to minimize the total cost of the tank given that we want it to hold 1000 cubic meters of volume. From this constraint, we have the equation , which we can solve for to get , so . This allows us to now write cost as a function of the single variable by substituting the expression for into the earlier formula we found for cost. In particular, Simplifying further, we have found that . Based on the physical constraints of the problem, we obviously will only consider values of and . Since , we must have so , and thus . We now work to minimize on the interval .  Taking the derivative of , we find that . Setting , it follows that and thus . Therefore, , so is the only critical number of ; observe that it lies within the interval .  If we plot the derivative function, , on the interval , we see that for , , and for , , which shows that is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number, and hence has a global minimum of , so $1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.

  "body": "    Draw a picture and introduce variables. It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables. Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step. Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation. A nice example of this can be seen in this applet , where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.    Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities. Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought, and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.    Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula. For example, in Preview Activity , we initially found that , but then the additional relationship that (girth plus length equals 108 inches) allows us to relate and and thus observe equivalently that . Substituting for in the volume equation yields , and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable .    Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized. Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on. Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.    Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and\/or minimum of the quantity being optimized. This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first. Then, depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers (for a closed, bounded interval), using ideas we've studied so far in Chapter .    Finally, we make certain we have answered the question: does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity, or the values of the variables that produce the maximum? That is, finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.     "

The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is 351562.5 square feet.   The farmer will fence a rectangular area whose length and width are unknown. The total area of the rectangular area is composed of 4 equal area rectangles. There are two ways to do this as shown in the figure below (though only the one on the left explicitly follows the way the problem is framed).

Assume that the company wants tanks that will hold 1000 cubic feet of gas, and that the ends are more expensive to make, costing $5 per square foot, while the cylindrical barrel between the ends costs $2 per square foot. Use calculus to determine the minimum cost to construct such a tank.   The minimum cost is $1165.70.   We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be with the radius of the cylinder given by . It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also .

The cylindrical part of the tank has volume , and the surface area of its sides is (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle). The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere, and the volume of a sphere is , while the surface area of a sphere is .

  "body": " Related Rates     If two quantities that are related, such as the radius and volume of a spherical balloon, are both changing as implicit functions of time, how are their rates of change related? That is, how does the relationship between the values of the quantities affect the relationship between their respective derivatives with respect to time?      In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable, say , changes with respect to another, say , leading us to compute and interpret . We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related, but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time, which will be represented by the variable . Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.  For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. Since the balloon's volume and radius are related, by knowing how fast the volume is changing, we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing. We are interested in questions such as: can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?   A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when or when ? Why?   Draw several spheres with different radii, and observe that as volume changes, the radius, diameter, and surface area of the balloon also change.    Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius is . Note well that in the setting of this problem, both  and are changing as time changes, and thus both and may be viewed as implicit functions of , with respective derivatives and . Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to (using the chain rule on the right) to find a formula for that depends on both and .    At this point in the problem, by differentiating we have related the rates of change of and . Recall that we are given in the problem that the balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. Is this rate the value of or ? Why?    From part (c), we know the value of at every value of . Next, observe that when the diameter of the balloon is 12, we know the value of the radius. In the equation , substitute these values for the relevant quantities and solve for the remaining unknown quantity, which is . How fast is the radius changing at the instant ?    How is the situation different when ? When is the radius changing more rapidly, when or when ?        Related Rates Problems  In problems where two or more quantities can be related to one another, and all of the variables involved are implicitly functions of time, , we are often interested in how their rates are related; we call these related rates problems. related rates Once we have an equation establishing the relationship among the variables, we differentiate implicitly with respect to time to find connections among the rates of change.    Sand is being dumped by a conveyor belt onto a pile so that the sand forms a right circular cone, as pictured in Figure . How are the instantaneous rates of change of the sand's volume, height, and radius related to one another?   A conical pile of sand.      As sand falls from the conveyor belt, several features of the sand pile will change: the volume of the pile will grow, the height will increase, and the radius will get bigger, too. All of these quantities are related to one another, and the rate at which each is changing is related to the rate at which sand falls from the conveyor.  We begin by identifying which variables are changing and how they are related. In this problem, we observe that the radius and height of the pile are related to its volume by the standard equation for the volume of a cone, .  Viewing each of , , and as functions of , we differentiate implicitly to arrive at an equation that relates their respective rates of change. Taking the derivative of each side of the equation with respect to , we find .  On the left, is simply . On the right, the situation is more complicated, as both and are implicit functions of . Hence we need the product and chain rules. We find that   (Note particularly how we are using ideas from Section on implicit differentiation. There we found that when is an implicit function of , . The same principles are applied here when we compute .)  The equation , relates the rates of change of , , and .    If we are given sufficient additional information, we may then find the value of one or more of these rates of change at a specific point in time.    In the setting of Example , suppose we also know the following: (a) sand falls from the conveyor in such a way that the height of the pile is always half the radius, and (b) sand falls from the conveyor belt at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute. How fast is the height of the sandpile changing at the moment the radius is 4 feet?    The information that the height is always half the radius tells us that for all values of , . Differentiating with respect to , it follows that . These relationships enable us to relate to just one of or . Substituting the expressions involving and for and , we now have that .  Since sand falls from the conveyor at the constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute, the value of , the rate at which the volume of the sand pile changes, is ft \/min. We are interested in how fast the height of the pile is changing at the instant when , so we substitute and into Equation , to find .  Only the value of remains unknown. We combine like terms on the right side of the equation above to get , and solve for to find feet per minute. Because we were interested in how fast the height of the pile was changing at this instant, we want to know when . Since for all values of , it follows .    Note the difference between the notations and . The former represents the rate of change of with respect to at an arbitrary value of , while the latter is the rate of change of with respect to at a particular moment, the moment when .  Had we known that at the beginning of Example , we could have immediately simplified our work by writing solely in terms of to have .  From this last equation, differentiating with respect to implies , from which the same conclusions can be made.  Our work with the sandpile problem above is similar in many ways to our approach in Preview Activity , and these steps are typical of most related rates problems. In certain ways, they also resemble work we do in applied optimization problems, and here we summarize the main approach for consideration in subsequent problems.      Identify the quantities in the problem that are changing and choose clearly defined variable names for them. Draw one or more figures that clearly represent the situation.    Determine all rates of change that are known or given and identify the rate(s) of change to be found.    Find an equation that relates the variables whose rates of change are known to those variables whose rates of change are to be found.    Differentiate implicitly with respect to to relate the rates of change of the involved quantities.    Evaluate the derivatives and variables at the information relevant to the instant at which a certain rate of change is sought. Use proper notation to identify when a derivative is being evaluated at a particular instant, such as .      When identifying variables and drawing a picture, it is important to think about the dynamic ways in which the quantities change. Sometimes a sequence of pictures can be helpful; for some pictures that can be easily modified as applets built in Geogebra, see the following links, We again refer to the work of Prof. Marc Renault of Shippensburg University, found at gvsu.edu\/s\/5p . which represent   how a circular oil slick's area grows as its radius increases;    how the location of the base of a ladder and its height along a wall change as the ladder slides;    how the water level changes in a conical tank as it fills with water at a constant rate (compare the problem in Activity );    how a skateboarder's shadow changes as he moves past a lamppost.     Drawing well-labeled diagrams and envisioning how different parts of the figure change is a key part of understanding related rates problems and being successful at solving them.    A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8 feet. Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.   Draw a picture of the conical tank, including a sketch of the water level at a point in time when the tank is not yet full. Introduce variables that measure the radius of the water's surface and the water's depth in the tank, and label them on your figure.    Say that is the radius and the depth of the water at a given time, . What equation relates the radius and height of the water, and why?    Determine an equation that relates the volume of water in the tank at time to the depth of the water at that time.    Through differentiation, find an equation that relates the instantaneous rate of change of water volume with respect to time to the instantaneous rate of change of water depth at time .    Find the instantaneous rate at which the water level is rising when the water in the tank is 3 feet deep.    When is the water rising most rapidly: at , , or ?               Think about similar triangles.    Recall that the volume of a cone is .    Remember to differentiate implicitly with respect to .    Use and the fact that the value of is given.    Consider this visualization . Why does this phenomenon occur?                .     .     .     feet per minute.    Most rapidly when .          Letting represent the water's radius at time and the water's depth, we see the following situation:       Observe that the right triangle with legs of length and is similar to the right triangle with legs of length and , respectively, based on how the water assumes the shape of the tank, and thus , so that .    Since the water in the tank always takes the shape of a circular cone, the volume of water in the tank at time is given by . Because we have established that , it follows that .    Differentiating with respect to , we now find , which relates the rates of change of and .    It is given in the problem setting that water is entering the tank at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute, hence , and we are interested in the rate of change of the water's depth when . Substituting these values into the equation that relates and , we find that , so that feet per minute.    Having established that , using and solving for , we have . This relationship between and shows that as increases, decreases. Thus, the water (which enters the tank at a constant rate) is rising most rapidly when , and this matches our intuition for how the water should rise in the conical tank: quickly at first, and then ever more slowly as time progresses.       Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem is often the key to finding the function to optimize. For instance, although the problem in Activity is about a conical tank, the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved. In another setting, we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle. But in the conical tank, the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship. In other situations where a changing angle is involved, trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.    A television camera is positioned 4000 feet from the base of a rocket launching pad. The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight. In addition, the auto-focus of the camera has to take into account the increasing distance between the camera and the rocket. We assume that the rocket rises vertically. (A similar problem is discussed and pictured dynamically . Exploring the applet at the link will be helpful to you in answering the questions that follow.)   Draw a figure that summarizes the given situation. What parts of the picture are changing? What parts are constant? Introduce appropriate variables to represent the quantities that are changing.    Find an equation that relates the camera's angle of elevation to the height of the rocket, and then find an equation that relates the instantaneous rate of change of the camera's elevation angle to the instantaneous rate of change of the rocket's height (where all rates of change are with respect to time).    Find an equation that relates the distance from the camera to the rocket to the rocket's height, as well as an equation that relates the instantaneous rate of change of distance from the camera to the rocket to the instantaneous rate of change of the rocket's height (where all rates of change are with respect to time).    Suppose that the rocket's speed is 600 ft\/sec at the instant it has risen 3000 feet. How fast is the distance from the television camera to the rocket changing at that moment? If the camera is following the rocket, how fast is the camera's angle of elevation changing at that same moment?    If from an elevation of 3000 feet onward the rocket continues to rise at 600 feet\/sec, will the rate of change of distance with respect to time be greater when the elevation is 4000 feet than it was at 3000 feet, or less? Why?          Let represent the camera angle and note that one leg of the right triangle is constant. Which two are changing?    Think trigonometrically.    Think like Pythagoras.    Use the facts that and in your preceding work.    You can answer this question intuitively or by changing the value of in your work in (d).                .     .      radians per second.    greater.          Letting be the camera's elevation angle, the rocket's height, and the distance from the camera to the rocket, we have the following situation at a given point in time:       To relate and , observe that the tangent function is a good choice, since , so that . Differentiating implicitly with respect to , we find that .    To relate and , the Pythagorean Theorem is natural to consider. By this famous result, . Differentiating both sides implicitly with respect to , it follows , and thus .    Using the given fact that the rocket's speed is 600 ft\/sec at the instant it has risen 3000 feet, we know that . Note further in the triangle that when , it follows , since the base leg of the triangle is constant at 4000, by using the Pythagorean Theorem. Substituting this information from the instant into the equation that relates the rates of change of and found in (c), we find that . Solving for we have . To answer the question about how fast the camera angle is changing, we use the same information but now in the equation we found in (b) that relates the rates of change of and : . Observe that when , in the 3000-4000-5000 right triangle, it follows that , so . Thus, using the instantaneous information, , and thus , which is measured in radians per second.    Recalling that , it follows that . Using this equation when and led us to conclude that . If we instead use , it follows that , so that . Indeed, is an increasing function of , provided that is constant, because we can write , so , making . It is straightforward to verify that is an increasing function of .       In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate, it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship: we mean to say that while the depth, , of the water is increasing, its rate of change, , is decreasing (both as a function of and as a function of ). We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate, without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in Activity , we established that , and hence .  Provided that is constant, it is immediately apparent that as gets larger, will get smaller but remain positive. Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.    As pictured in the applet , a skateboarder who is 6 feet tall rides under a 15 foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of 3 feet per second. We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.   Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder, lamppost, and his shadow. Let denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and represent the length of his shadow. Label these quantities, as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.    Observe that the skateboarder and the lamppost represent parallel line segments in the diagram, and thus similar triangles are present. Use similar triangles to establish an equation that relates and .    Use your work in (b) to find an equation that relates and .    At what rate is the length of the skateboarder's shadow increasing at the instant the skateboarder is 8 feet from the lamppost?    As the skateboarder's distance from the lamppost increases, is his shadow's length increasing at an increasing rate, increasing at a decreasing rate, or increasing at a constant rate?    Which is moving more rapidly: the skateboarder or the tip of his shadow? Explain, and justify your answer.          Note that the lengths of the legs of the right triangle will be for the vertical one and for the horizontal one.    The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs and is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs.    Simplify the equation in (b) as much as possible before differentiating implicitly with respect to .    Find .    Does the equation that relates and involve ? Is changing or constant?    Let represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that .                .     .     feet per second.    at a constant rate.    Let represent the location of the tip of the shadow; feet\/sec.          The given information leads us to construct the following diagram:       The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs of length and is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs (length 15) and horizontal leg of length . Because the ratios of the lengths of the legs of these two triangles is equal, we have . Simplifying, we have , so that , or most simply, .    Differentiating with respect to , it is immediate that .    Since , and , it follows for every value of (and ). Thus, feet per second.    Because is constant, the shadow's length is increasing at a constant rate (irrespective of the distance from the skateboarder to the lamppost).    Let represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that . Observe that we can now compute in terms of and , with feet\/sec, and hence the tip of the shadow is moving more rapidly than the skateboarder himself.       In the first three activities of this section, we provided guided instruction to build a solution in a step by step way. For the closing activity and the following exercises, most of the detailed work is left to the reader.    A baseball diamond is square. A batter hits a ball along the third base line and runs to first base. At what rate is the distance between the ball and first base changing when the ball is halfway to third base, if at that instant the ball is traveling feet\/sec? At what rate is the distance between the ball and the runner changing at the same instant, if at the same instant the runner is of the way to first base running at feet\/sec?    Let denote the position of the ball along the third base line at time , and the distance from the ball to first base. Note that the basepaths meet at 90 degree angles.    Let denote the position of the ball at time and the distance from the ball to first base, as pictured below.      .  Let be the runner's position at time and let be the distance between the runner and the ball, as pictured.      .    We let denote the position of the ball at time and the distance from the ball to first base, as pictured below.

Differentiating each side with respect to , it follows that the three rates of change are related by the equation .  We are given that at the instant , , so by Pythagoras, . In addition, at this same instant we know that and . Applying this information, and therefore .      Summary     When two or more related quantities are changing as implicit functions of time, their rates of change can be related by implicitly differentiating the equation that relates the quantities themselves. For instance, if the sides of a right triangle are all changing as functions of time, say having lengths , , and , then these quantities are related by the Pythagorean Theorem: . It follows by implicitly differentiating with respect to that their rates are related by the equation , so that if we know the values of , , and at a particular time, as well as two of the three rates, we can deduce the value of the third.         Height of a conical pile of gravel   Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of cubic feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height are always the same. How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is feet high? Recall that the volume of a right circular cone with height and radius of the base is given by .  When the pile is feet high, its height is increasing at feet per minute.        We are given that the diameter and height are always the same, so ,or . Hence, the volume of the pile is Differentiating with respect to time ( ) gives and so If and , then Hence, when the pile is feet high its height is increasing at a rate of feet per minute.

A leaking conical tank   Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of  at the same time that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant rate.

If the water level is rising at a rate of when the height of the water is , find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute.  Answer:    be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in. Then you know that if is volume of water, . Use geometry (similar triangles) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time. Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius and height is given by        The volume of a cone of diameter and height is We might as well do this problem a little more generally than stated. (It actually makes things clearer to use variables throughout and substitute specific values only at the end.) So suppose the diameter of our tank is and its height is . Suppose the depth of the water is and the radius of the surface is . Then, by similar triangles, or Substituting in the volume formula gives Differentiating gives: This rate of change in volume would be the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank if there was no leak. However, if is the leak rate then  Note that since we have to have consistent units of length, and the answer is in cubic centimeters per minute, the lengths given in meters have to be converted to centimeters.  Thus, substituting we obtain        A sailboat is sitting at rest near its dock. A rope attached to the bow of the boat is drawn in over a pulley that stands on a post on the end of the dock that is 5 feet higher than the bow. If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet?   The boat is approaching the dock at a rate of feet per second.   Using the given information, we construct the figure shown below.     As pictured, we know that is the vertical height from the pulley to the level of the bow of the boat, and we let be the length of the rope from the pulley to the bow of the boat, and the horizontal distance from the dock to the bow of the boat.  We are given that the rope is being pulled in at feet per second, and thus feet per second. Because we want to know how fast the boat is approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet, we want to know . Thus, we need to relate the changing quantities and .  Because the rope, the post (vertically extended), and the horizontal distance from the bow of the boat to the post on the dock form a right triangle at all times, it follows that . Having now related and , we differentiate this equation with respect to . By the chain rule, we now see that . At the instant , , and thus .

A swimming pool is feet long and feet wide. Its depth varies uniformly from feet at the shallow end to feet at the deep end, as shown in the Figure .   The swimming pool.    Suppose the pool has been emptied and is now being filled with water at a rate of cubic feet per minute. At what rate is the depth of water (measured at the deepest point of the pool) increasing when it is feet deep at that end? Over time, describe how the depth of the water will increase: at an increasing rate, at a decreasing rate, or at a constant rate. Explain.   The depth of the water is increasing at feet per minute. The depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.   The variables in this problem are the volume of water in the pool and the depth of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool); each is implicitly a function of time, . We are given that is a constant cubic feet per minute and want to find . To do this, we first need to relate and . The volume of the water in the pool at height is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height (as shown in the figure below) times the width (25 feet) of the pool. The height of the triangular cross section is and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.     Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points and . This line has slope and -intercept . So the equation of this line is . It is the coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the -coordinate that is the length of the triangle whose height is . So the length is . Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height is . Both and are functions of time. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to gives , so . When the depth of water in the pool is feet, then the depth is increasing at the rate feet per minute. Since is inversely proportional to , the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as increases, so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.

As pictured, we know that is the vertical height from the pulley to the level of the bow of the boat, and we let be the length of the rope from the pulley to the bow of the boat, and the horizontal distance from the dock to the bow of the boat.  We are given that the rope is being pulled in at feet per second, and thus feet per second. Because we want to know how fast the boat is approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet, we want to know . Thus, we need to relate the changing quantities and .  Because the rope, the post (vertically extended), and the horizontal distance from the bow of the boat to the post on the dock form a right triangle at all times, it follows that . Having now related and , we differentiate this equation with respect to . By the chain rule, we now see that . At the instant , , and thus . Using all of the given information at the instant (including that ), . Solving for , feet per second. Thus the boat is approaching the dock at a rate of feet per second.  "

  "body": " Determining distance traveled from velocity     If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval, can we determine the distance the object has traveled on the time interval?    How is the problem of finding distance traveled related to finding the area under a certain curve?    What does it mean to antidifferentiate a function and why is this process relevant to finding distance traveled?    If velocity is negative, how does this impact the problem of finding distance traveled?      In the first section of the text, we considered a moving object with known position at time , namely, a tennis ball tossed into the air with height (in feet) at time (in seconds) given by . We investigated the average velocity of the ball on an interval , computed by the difference quotient . We found that we could determine the instantaneous velocity of the ball at time by taking the derivative of the position function, .  Thus, if its position function is differentiable, we can find the velocity of a moving object at any point in time.  From this study of position and velocity we have learned a great deal. We can use the derivative to find a function's instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain, to find where the function is increasing or decreasing, where it is concave up or concave down, and to locate relative extremes. The vast majority of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the situation where a particular function is known and we seek information that relies on knowing the function's instantaneous rate of change. For all these tasks, we proceed from a function to its derivative, , and use the meaning of the derivative to help us answer important questions.  We have also encountered the reverse situation, where we know the derivative of a function, , and try to deduce information about . We will focus our attention in Chapter on this problem: if we know the instantaneous rate of change of a function, can we find the function itself? We start with a more specific question: if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object moving along a straight line path, can we find its corresponding position function?   Suppose that a person is taking a walk along a long straight path and walks at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour.   On the left-hand axes provided in Figure , sketch a labeled graph of the velocity function .   At left, axes for plotting ; at right, for plotting .    Note that while the scale on the two sets of axes is the same, the units on the right-hand axes differ from those on the left. The right-hand axes will be used in question (d).    How far did the person travel during the two hours? How is this distance related to the area of a certain region under the graph of ?    Find an algebraic formula, , for the position of the person at time , assuming that . Explain your thinking.    On the right-hand axes provided in Figure , sketch a labeled graph of the position function .    For what values of is the position function increasing? Explain why this is the case using relevant information about the velocity function .        Area under the graph of the velocity function  area under velocity function  In Preview Activity , we learned that when the velocity of a moving object's velocity is constant (and positive), the area under the velocity curve over an interval of time tells us the distance the object traveled.   At left, a constant velocity function; at right, a non-constant velocity function.    The left-hand graph of Figure shows the velocity of an object moving at 2 miles per hour over the time interval . The area of the shaded region under on is .  This result is simply the fact that distance equals rate times time, provided the rate is constant. Thus, if is constant on the interval , the distance traveled on is equal to the area given by , where is the change in over the interval. (Since the velocity is constant, we can use any value of on the interval , we simply chose , the value at the interval's left endpoint.) For several examples where the velocity function is piecewise constant, see this applet .  The situation is more complicated when the velocity function is not constant. But on relatively small intervals where does not vary much, we can use the area principle to estimate the distance traveled. The graph at right in Figure shows a non-constant velocity function. On the interval , the velocity varies from down to . One estimate for the distance traveled is the area of the pictured rectangle, .  Note that because is decreasing on , is an over-estimate of the actual distance traveled.   To estimate the area under this non-constant velocity function on a wider interval, say , one rectangle will not give a good approximation. Instead, we could use the six rectangles pictured in Figure , find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total. Obviously there are choices to make and issues to understand: How many rectangles should we use? Where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle's height? What happens if the velocity is sometimes negative? Can we find the exact area under any non-constant curve?   Using six rectangles to estimate the area under on .     We will study these questions and more in what follows; for now it suffices to observe that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool for estimating distance traveled from a velocity function, as well as for estimating the area under an arbitrary curve. To explore the use of multiple rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function, see this applet .    Suppose that a person is walking in such a way that her velocity varies slightly according to the information given in Table and graph given in Figure .    Velocity data for the person walking.                                              The graph of .        Using the grid, graph, and given data appropriately, estimate the distance traveled by the walker during the two hour interval from to . You should use time intervals of width , choosing a way to use the function consistently to determine the height of each rectangle in order to approximate distance traveled.    How could you get a better approximation of the distance traveled on ? Explain, and then find this new estimate.    Now suppose that you know that is given by . Remember that is the derivative of the walker's position function, . Find a formula for so that .    Based on your work in (c), what is the value of ? What is the meaning of this quantity?          For instance, the approximate distance traveled on can be computed by miles.    Think about the possibility of using a larger number of rectangles.    If and we seek a function such that , note that has to involve .    Observe that this quantity is measuring a change in position.              Thus, miles.    Using 8 rectangles of width , .     .     .          Using rectangles of width and choosing to set the heights of the rectangles from the function value at the left end of the interval, we see the following graph and find the sum of the areas of the rectangles to be Thus, the distance traveled is approximately miles.       It appears that a better approximation could be found using narrower rectangles. If we move to 8 rectangles of width , similar computations show that .    By thinking about how the power rule for differentiation works, we can undo this rule and find a position function whose derivative is . For instance, since , we see that . Thus, if we let , then it is straightforward to check that , which is precisely the formula for that we were given.    By the rule found in (c) for , we have that . This is the change in the walker's position over the time interval , and since the velocity is always positive, this is actually the exact distance traveled. We see how both earlier estimates ( and ) are good approximations to this value.         Two approaches: area and antidifferentiation  antidifferentiation  distance traveled  When the velocity of a moving object is positive, the object's position is always increasing. (We will soon consider situations where velocity is negative; for now, we focus on the situation where velocity is always positive.) We have established that whenever is constant on an interval, the exact distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve. When is not constant, we can estimate the total distance traveled by finding the areas of rectangles that approximate the area under the velocity curve.  Thus, we see that finding the area between a curve and the horizontal axis is an important exercise: besides being an interesting geometric question, if the curve gives the velocity of a moving object, the area under the curve tells us the exact distance traveled on an interval. We can estimate this area if we have a graph or a table of values for the velocity function.  In Activity , we encountered an alternate approach to finding the distance traveled. If is a formula for the instantaneous velocity of a moving object, then must be the derivative of the object's position function, . If we can find a formula for from the formula for , we will know the position of the object at time , and the change in position over a particular time interval tells us the distance traveled on that interval.  For a simple example, consider the situation from Preview Activity , where a person is walking along a straight line with velocity function mph.   The velocity function and corresponding position function .    On the left-hand graph of the velocity function in Figure , we see the relationship between area and distance traveled, . In addition, we observe Here we are making the implicit assumption that ; we will discuss different possibilities for values of in subsequent study. that if , then , so is the position function whose derivative is the given velocity function, . The respective locations of the person at times and are and , and therefore .  This is the person's change in position on , which is precisely the distance traveled. In this example there are profound ideas and connections that we will study throughout Chapter .  For now, observe that if we know a formula for a velocity function , it can be very helpful to find a function that satisfies . We say that is an antiderivative of . More generally, we have the following formal definition.    If and are functions such that , we say that is an antiderivative  antiderivative of .    For example, if , is an antiderivative of , because . Note that we say an antiderivative of rather than the antiderivative of , because is also a function whose derivative is , and thus is another antiderivative of .    A ball is tossed vertically in such a way that its velocity function is given by , where is measured in seconds and in feet per second. Assume that this function is valid for .     For what values of is the velocity of the ball positive? What does this tell you about the motion of the ball on this interval of time values?    Find an antiderivative, , of that satisfies .    Compute the value of . What is the meaning of the value you find?    Using the graph of provided in Figure , find the exact area of the region between the velocity curve and the -axis between and . What is the meaning of the value you find?   The graph of .      Answer the same questions as in (c) and (d) but instead using the interval .    What is the value of ? What does this result tell you about the flight of the ball? How is this value connected to the provided graph of ? Explain.          Where is velocity zero?    Since is linear, note that must be quadratic.    Observe that you are taking the difference between two values of the position function.    The region whose area is sought is triangular.    See (c) and (d) above.    What does it mean for the change of the ball's position to be zero?          On , is increasing because velocity is positive.     .     .     feet is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on .     is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval . Equivalently, the area between the velocity curve and the -axis on is feet.     , so the ball has zero change in position on the interval .          Note that and for , . This means that on the interval , the position function is increasing because velocity is positive.    We can check that the derivative of is , and that , so this is the antiderivative of that we desire.    Now, , which is the change in position of the ball on the interval . Equivalently, since is positive through this interval, 4 feet is the vertical distance the ball traveled during this time.    On the interval from to , the corresponding area between the velocity curve and the -axis is the area of the right triangular region whose width is seconds and whose height is feet\/sec. That area is therefore feet. This is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on .     , which is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval . The area between the velocity curve and the -axis on is the area of the triangle with height 32 (ft\/sec) and base 1 (second), which is feet. These two results are identical, in part due to the fact that we are using two different perspectives to compute the same quantity, which is distance traveled.    Observe that . This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval . But we already established that on the interval , the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval , there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the -axis as being negative wherever is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the total area being zero, matching the change in position.         When velocity is negative  The assumption that the velocity is positive on a given interval guarantees that the movement of an object is always in a single direction, and hence ensures that its change in position is the same as the distance it travels. As we saw in Activity , there are natural settings in which an object's velocity is negative, and we would like to understand this scenario as well.  Consider a simple example where a woman goes for a walk on the beach along a stretch of very straight shoreline that runs east-west. We assume that her initial position is , and that her position function increases as she moves east from her starting location. For instance, mile represents one mile east of the start location, while tells us she is one mile west of where she began walking on the beach.  Now suppose she walks in the following manner. From the outset at , she walks due east at a constant rate of mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, she stops abruptly and begins walking due west at a constant rate of mph and does so for 0.5 hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, she resumes walking at a constant rate of mph to the east for one more hour. What is the total distance she traveled on the time interval from to ? What is the total change in her position over that time?  These questions are possible to answer without calculus because the velocity is constant on each interval. From to , she traveled .  On to , the distance traveled is .  Finally, in the last hour she walked , so the total distance she traveled is .  Since the velocity for is , indicating motion in the westward direction, the woman first walked 4.5 miles east, then 2 miles west, followed by 3 more miles east. Thus, the total change in her position is .  We have been able to answer these questions fairly easily, and if we think about the problem graphically, we can generalize our solution to the more complicated setting when velocity is not constant, and possibly negative.   At left, the velocity function of the person walking; at right, the corresponding position function.    In Figure , we see how the distances we computed can be viewed as areas: comes from multiplying rate times time ( ), as do and . But while is an area (and is therefore positive), because the velocity function is negative for , this area has a negative sign associated with it. The negative area distinguishes between distance traveled and change in position.  The distance traveled is the sum of the areas, .  But the change in position has to account for travel in the negative direction. An area above the -axis is considered positive because it represents distance traveled in the positive direction, while one below the -axis is viewed as negative because it represents travel in thenegative direction. Thus, the change in the woman's position is . In other words, the woman walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction, followed by two miles in the negative direction, and then 3 more miles in the positive direction.  Negative velocity is also seen in the graph of the position function . Its slope is negative (specifically, ) on the interval because the velocity is on that interval. The negative slope shows the position function is decreasing because the woman is walking east, rather than west.  To summarize, we see that if velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object's change in position is different from its distance traveled. If we compute separately the distance traveled on each interval where velocity is positive or negative, we can calculate either the total distance traveled or the total change in position. We assign a negative value to distances traveled in the negative direction when we calculate change in position, but a positive value when we calculate the total distance traveled.    Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity (in meters per second) at time (in seconds) given by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured at left in Figure . We view movement to the right as being in the positive direction (with positive velocity), while movement to the left is in the negative direction.   The velocity function of a moving object.    Suppose further that the object's initial position at time is .   Determine the total distance traveled and the total change in position on the time interval . What is the object's position at ?    On what time intervals is the moving object's position function increasing? Why? On what intervals is the object's position decreasing? Why?    What is the object's position at ? How many total meters has it traveled to get to this point (including distance in both directions)? Is this different from the object's total change in position on to ?    Find the exact position of the object at and use this data to sketch an accurate graph of on the axes provided at right in Figure . How can you use the provided information about to determine the concavity of on each relevant interval?          Find the area of each triangular region formed between and the -axis.    Recall that , and here we are given complete information about .    Be careful to address whether is positive or negative when calculating areas and adding the results.    Consider finding the area bounded by and the -axis on each interval , , .          Total distance traveled is ; change in position is .     and .     , while the distance traveled on is , and thus these two quantities are different.    See the figure below.             By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between and the -axis on and (each of which is ), it follows that the object's total distance traveled is , while its change in position is . The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by on is . Finally, the object's position at is     The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive, hence for and .    By calculating the area bounded by the curve, we find 1 unit of area on , 4 units of area on , and 8 units of area on , thus the total distance traveled on is meters. As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval, we find that the change in position is . We thus observe that the distance traveled and change in position on are different.    In the figure below, at left we list all of the areas bounded by on each one-unit subinterval. Along with the given starting point that , we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function . For instance, we know , hence . Similarly, , thus . Continuing across the interval, we generate the function that is pictured at right. Note that the portion of from to is linear because is constant there, while the other parts of appear to be quadratic, as they correspond to intervals where is linear.            Summary     If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval and the velocity is positive throughout, we can estimate the object's distance traveled and in some circumstances determine this value exactly.    In particular, when velocity is positive on an interval, we can find the total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity curve and above the -axis on the given time interval. We may only be able to estimate this area, depending on the shape of the velocity curve.    An antiderivative of a function is a new function whose derivative is . That is, is an antiderivative of provided that . In the context of velocity and position, if we know a velocity function , an antiderivative of is a position function that satisfies . If is positive on a given interval, say , then the change in position, , measures the distance the moving object traveled on .    If its velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object is sometimes traveling in the opposite direction or backtracking. To determine distance traveled, we have to compute the distance separately on intervals where velocity is positive or negative, and account for the change in position on each such interval.       Estimating distance traveled from velocity data   A car comes to a stop six seconds after the driver applies the brakes. While the brakes are on, the following velocities are recorded:    Time since brakes applied (sec)  0  2  4  6    Velocity (ft\/s)  90  46  17  0    Give lower and upper estimates (using all of the available data) for the distance the car traveled after the brakes were applied.  lower:  upper:  (for each, include help (units) )  On a sketch of velocity against time, show the lower and upper estimates you found above. .             SOLUTION  To find a lower estimate for the distance the car has traveled, we use the lowest velocity for each of the intervals , , and to calculate an estimated distance traveled in each interval. This gives Similarly, for the upper estimate, we take the maximum velocity for each interval, to get  Graphically, each of the terms in these sums is the area of a rectangle, as shown outlined in blue in the figures below. The lower- and upper estimates are the sum of the areas of these rectangles. (Note that the height of the last rectangle for the lower estimate is zero, so it does not contribute to the sum.)        lower estimate  upper estimate    (Click on the graphs to see a larger version.)       Distance from a linear velocity function   The velocity of a car is meters\/second. Use a graph of to find the exact distance traveled by the car, in meters, from to seconds.  distance = (include help (units) )        SOLUTION  A graph of the velocity is   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  The distance traveled is just the area under the curve, which is the area of a right triangle. Thus the distance traveled is       Change in position from a linear velocity function   The velocity of a particle moving along the -axis is given by cm\/sec. Use a graph of to find the exact change in position of the particle from time to seconds.  change in position = (include help (units) )        SOLUTION  A graph of the velocity is   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  The distance traveled is just the area under the curve. Note that in this case, this includes positive area (that above the -axis), indicating forward motion, and negative area (that below the -axis), indicating backward motion. The exact change in position is therefore       Comparing distance traveled from velocity graphs   Two cars start at the same time and travel in the same direction along a straight road. The figure below gives the velocity, (in km\/hr), of each car as a function of time (in hr).   The velocity of car A is given by the solid, blue curve, and the velocity of car B by dashed, red curve.  (a)  Which car attains the larger maximum velocity?   A    B    (b)  Which stops first?   A    B    (c)  Which travels farther?   A    B     SOLUTION  (a)  Car B has a velocity that attains the largest maximum value.  (b)  The graph of the velocity of car B returns to zero first, so that car stops first.  (c)  The area under the velocity curve for A is largest, so that car travels the farthest.       Finding average acceleration from velocity data   Suppose that an accelerating car goes from 0 mph to 68.2 mph in five seconds. Its velocity is given in the following table, converted from miles per hour to feet per second, so that all time measurements are in seconds. (Note: 1 mph is 22\/15 feet per sec = 22\/15 ft\/s.) Find the average acceleration of the car over each of the first two seconds.     0  1  2  3  4  5     0.00  34.09  59.09  77.27  90.91  100.00    average acceleration over the first second = (include help (units) )  average aceleration over the second second = (include help (units) )             SOLUTION  To measure the average acceleration over an interval, we calculate the average rate of change of velocity over the interval. The units of acceleration are ft\/s per second, or ft\/s\/s, written ft\/s . so, reading the velocities from the table, we have Similarly,       Change in position from a quadratic velocity function   The velocity function is for a particle moving along a line.

For the purposes of this problem, assume the road is completely straight, and that the function tracks the position of the biker along this path in miles north of Pigeon Lake, which lies roughly halfway between the ends of the bike path.  Suppose that the biker's velocity function is given by the graph in Figure on the time interval (where is measured in hours), and that .   The graph of the biker's velocity, , at left.

The velocity function of the biker tells us that for the first hour, the biker pedals north at a velocity of miles per hour. At the -hour mark, the biker abruptly changes direction and then pedals south at miles per hour for the next two hours; finally, at the -hour mark, the biker again changes direction and then pedals north at mph for the last hour of their trip.  Thus, the biker traveled miles north from their starting point (mile ) and thus made the turn at at mile . Two hours later, having pedaled south at mph, they'd traveled miles south, and thus were at mile relative to Pigeon Lake. Finally, after biking at mph north for the lat hour, they were back at mile .  The furthest north the biker was occurred at time . This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker's position function changes from positive to negative, and thus has a local maximum. In addition, we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals, and that the biker was miles north of the lake at .    In part (a), we established that , so the biker traveled miles north in the first hour. For the second hour, the biker travels due south at mph, and thus travels miles south. This means that at , their position is We were given that . Thus, , and the biker is mile north of the lake.    The cyclist first traveled miles north, then miles south, and finally miles north. Since , their total distance traveled is miles, even though their change of position , as established in (b).    In the following figure, we see an approximate plot of the biker's position function. Since their velocity is constant on the various intervals, their position function is linear on those intervals with slope that matches the velocity. In addition, as pictured, the position function passes through the points we've established above like .          A toy rocket is launched vertically from the ground on a day with no wind. The rocket's vertical velocity at time (in seconds) is given by feet\/sec.   At what time after the rocket is launched does the rocket's velocity equal zero? Call this time value . What happens to the rocket at ?    Find the value of the total area enclosed by and the -axis on the interval . What does this area represent in terms of the physical setting of the problem?    Find an antiderivative of the function . That is, find a function such that .    Compute the value of . What does this number represent in terms of the physical setting of the problem?    Compute . What does this number tell you about the rocket's flight?          is when the rocket reaches its maximum height.     , the vertical distance traveled on .     .     is the change of the rocket's position on .     ; the rocket rose feet on .         Setting , we find , and thus . This is the time that the rocket's velocity changes from positive to negative, and thus the point when the rocket's position changes from increasing to decreasing: it's when the rocket reaches its maximum height.    Since is a positive linear function that connects the points and on the interval , the region enclosed by the velocity function and the -axis is a right triangle with vertical leg of length and horizontal leg of length . The area of this triangle is . Because this is the area under the velocity curve (where velocity is positive) this area represents the vertical distance traveled by the rocket on the time interval .    One function that has derivative is .    Using our result in (c), . Thus, the change of the rocket's position on is feet, which is also the distance the rocket traveled vertically on the time interval, since velocity is positive throughout.    We find that , which tells us that the rocket rose feet on the -second interval from to .

Determine the exact total distance the object traveled on .    What is the value and meaning of , where is the position function of the moving object?    On which time interval did the object travel the greatest distance: , , or ?    On which time interval(s) is the position function increasing? At which point(s) does achieve a relative maximum?          .     is the change in position of the object on .    On the time interval .     is increasing on the intervals and ; the position function has a relative maximum at .         To find the exact total distance traveled, we need to calculate the area under the velocity function on the interval . This area is the sum of the areas of the triangular region of height and base length on the interval plus the area of the quarter circle of radius on the interval . So the total distance the object traveled on is .    The meaning of is the change in position, or total displacement, of the object on the time interval . Note that was found to be in part (a) and . So, , which means that the object moved 2 feet back toward its original position from time to time .    In part (a) we calculated the distance traveled by the object on the interval to be approximately feet. On the time interval , the object is moving in the opposite direction from the motion on the interval , and the total distance traveled is the area bounds below the -axis on the interval . This area is the sum of the areas of the triangle of height and base length on the interval and the area of the rectangle of height and length on the interval . So the total distance traveled by the object on the interval is . The total distance traveled by the object on the interval is the area bounds above the -axis on the interval . This area is the area of the semicircle of radius on the interval . So the total distance traveled by the object on the interval is . Thus, the object traveled the greatest distance on the time interval .    We know that the position function is increasing when the velocity is positive, so is increasing on the intervals and . Since is positive to the left of and then negative to the right of , the position function is increasing to the left of then decreasing to the right of . Thus, the position function has a relative maximum point at . There are no other points with this property, so this is the only relative maximum value of on this interval. We also can note that increases from to , culminating in a local maximum value at .       Filters at a water treatment plant become dirtier over time and thus become less effective; they are replaced every 30 days. During one 30-day period, the rate at which pollution passes through the filters into a nearby lake (in units of particulate matter per day) is measured every 6 days and is given in the following table. The time is measured in days since the filters were replaced.   Pollution data for the water filters.    Day,          Rate of pollution in units per day,              Plot the given data on a set of axes with time on the horizontal axis and the rate of pollution on the vertical axis.    Explain why the amount of pollution that entered the lake during this 30-day period would be given exactly by the area bounded by and the -axis on the time interval .    Estimate the total amount of pollution entering the lake during this 30-day period. Carefully explain how you determined your estimate.              Think about the product of the units involved: ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days''. Connect this to the area of a thin vertical rectangle whose height is given by the curve.    An underestimate is units of pollution.         The plot below shows that the rate of pollution appears to be increasing at an increasing rate as time goes on.       If we think about an interval on which the rate of pollution is relatively constant and suppose the interval is wide, then the area under the curve on that interval is approximately the area of the rectangle whose width is and whose height is , the polution rate on that interval. When we compute the product to find the area, the units involved are ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days'', which results in an overall unit of ``units of pollution''. Thus, the area under the curve tells us the total pollution emitted over the time interval .    One way to estimate the total amount of pollution is to suppose the rate of pollution is constant on each of the intervals , , . For instance, we could assume the rate on is always units per day, and then the rate jumps to units per day on , and so on. Doing so, and using the ideas we discussed in (b), one estimate for the total pollution, , is total units of pollution. Note, for example, that when we compute this represents an estimate of the total amount of pollution emitted on the interval since we are assuming the plant emits units of pollution per day for 6 days. It is apparent that this particular estimate is an underestimate of the total amount of pollution since the rate is always increasing but we are choosing the lowest value of that rate on a given interval.

This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval . But we already established that on the interval , the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval , there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the -axis as being negative wherever is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the total area being zero, matching the change in position.

Estimate the total amount of pollution entering the lake during this 30-day period. Carefully explain how you determined your estimate.              Think about the product of the units involved: ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days''. Connect this to the area of a thin vertical rectangle whose height is given by the curve.    An underestimate is units of pollution.         The plot below shows that the rate of pollution appears to be increasing at an increasing rate as time goes on.       If we think about an interval on which the rate of pollution is relatively constant and suppose the interval is wide, then the area under the curve on that interval is approximately the area of the rectangle whose width is and whose height is , the polution rate on that interval. When we compute the product to find the area, the units involved are ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days'', which results in an overall unit of ``units of pollution''. Thus, the area under the curve tells us the total pollution emitted over the time interval .    One way to estimate the total amount of pollution is to suppose the rate of pollution is constant on each of the intervals , , . For instance, we could assume the rate on is always units per day, and then the rate jumps to units per day on , and so on. Doing so, and using the ideas we discussed in (b), one estimate for the total pollution, , is total units of pollution. Note, for example, that when we compute this represents an estimate of the total amount of pollution emitted on the interval since we are assuming the plant emits units of pollution per day for 6 days. It is apparent that this particular estimate is an underestimate of the total amount of pollution since the rate is always increasing but we are choosing the lowest value of that rate on a given interval.

  "body": " Riemann Sums     How can we use a Riemann sum to estimate the area between a given curve and the horizontal axis over a particular interval?    What are the differences among left, right, middle, and random Riemann sums?    How can we write Riemann sums in an abbreviated form?      In Section , we learned that if an object moves with positive velocity , the area between and the -axis over a given time interval tells us the distance traveled by the object over that time period. If is sometimes negative and we view the area of any region below the -axis as having an associated negative sign, then the sum of these signed areas tells us the moving object's change in position over a given time interval.   For instance, for the velocity function given in Figure , if the areas of shaded regions are , , and as labeled, then the total distance traveled by the moving object on is , while the total change in the object's position on is .   A velocity function that is sometimes negative.     Because the motion is in the negative direction on the interval where , we subtract to determine the object's total change in position.  Of course, finding and for the graph in Figure presumes that we can actually find the areas , , and . So far, we have worked with velocity functions that were either constant or linear, so that the area bounded by the velocity function and the horizontal axis is a combination of rectangles and triangles, and we can find the area exactly. But when the curve bounds a region that is not a familiar geometric shape, we cannot find its area exactly. Indeed, this is one of our biggest goals in Chapter : to learn how to find the exact area bounded between a curve and the horizontal axis for as many different types of functions as possible.  In Activity , we approximated the area under a nonlinear velocity function using rectangles. In the following preview activity, we consider three different options for the heights of the rectangles we will use.   A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles per hour at time given by the function , for times in the interval . The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams in Figure .   Three approaches to estimating the area under on the interval .    Note that in each diagram, we use four rectangles to estimate the area under on the interval , but the method by which the four rectangles' respective heights are decided varies among the three individual graphs.   How are the heights of rectangles in the left-most diagram being chosen? Explain, and hence determine the value of by evaluating the function at appropriately chosen values and observing the width of each rectangle. Note, for example, that .    Explain how the heights of rectangles are being chosen in the middle diagram and find the value of .    Likewise, determine the pattern of how heights of rectangles are chosen in the right-most diagram and determine .    Of the estimates , , and , which do you think is the best approximation of , the total distance the person traveled on ? Why?        Sigma Notation  We have used sums of areas of rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. Intuitively, we expect that using a larger number of thinner rectangles will provide a better estimate for the area. Consequently, we anticipate dealing with sums of a large number of terms. To do so, we introduce sigma notation , sigma notation named for the Greek letter , which is the capital letter in the Greek alphabet.  For example, say we are interested in the sum , the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. In sigma notation we write .  We read the symbol as the sum from equals 1 to 100 of . The variable is called the index of summation, and any letter can be used for this variable. The pattern in the terms of the sum is denoted by a function of the index; for example, , and more generally, .  Sigma notation allows us to vary easily the function being used to describe the terms in the sum, and to adjust the number of terms in the sum simply by changing the value of . We test our understanding of this new notation in the following activity.    For each sum written in sigma notation, write the sum long-hand and evaluate the sum to find its value. For each sum written in expanded form, write the sum in sigma notation.                                  Observe that when , . This is the first term in the sum.    Note that this sum starts at .    Since the terms in the sum increase by 4, try a function that somehow involves .    What pattern do you observe in the terms of the sum?    Write every term in the sum as a fraction with denominator .                     .     .     .                    Observe that each term in the sum differs from the previous term by 4. If we view as and as , we see that the pattern may be represented through the function , so that . We note that is the end value of the index since .    The sum is a sum of powers of , which we can express in sigma notation as .     .         Riemann Sums  When a moving body has a positive velocity function on a given interval , the area under the curve over the interval gives the total distance the body travels on . We are also interested in finding the exact area bounded by on an interval , regardless of the meaning or context of the function . For now, we continue to focus on finding an accurate estimate of this area by using a sum of the areas of rectangles. Unless otherwise indicated, we assume that is continuous and non-negative on .  The first choice we make in such an approximation is the number of rectangles.   Subdividing the interval into subintervals of equal length .    If we desire rectangles of equal width to subdivide the interval , then each rectangle must have width . We let , , and define , so that , , and so on, as pictured in Figure .  We use each subinterval as the base of a rectangle, and next choose the height of the rectangle on that subinterval. There are three standard choices: we can use the left endpoint of each subinterval, the right endpoint of each subinterval, or the midpoint of each. These are precisely the options encountered in Preview Activity and seen in Figure . We next explore how these choices can be described in sigma notation.  Consider an arbitrary positive function on with the interval subdivided as shown in Figure , and choose to use left endpoints. Then on each interval , the area of the rectangle formed is given by , as seen in Figure .   Subdividing the interval into subintervals of equal length and approximating the area under over using left rectangles.    If we let denote the sum of the areas of these rectangles, we see that . In the more compact sigma notation, we have .  Note that since the index of summation begins at and ends at , there are indeed terms in this sum. We call the left Riemann sum  Riemann sum  Riemann sum left for the function on the interval .  To see how the Riemann sums for right endpoints and midpoints are constructed, we consider Figure .   Riemann sums using right endpoints and midpoints.    For the sum with right endpoints, we see that the area of the rectangle on an arbitrary interval is given by , and that the sum of all such areas of rectangles is given by .  We call the right Riemann sum  Riemann sum right for the function on the interval .  For the sum that uses midpoints, we introduce the notation so that is the midpoint of the interval . For instance, for the rectangle with area in Figure , we now have .  Hence, the sum of all the areas of rectangles that use midpoints is , and we say that is the middle Riemann sum  Riemann sum middle for on .  Thus, we have two variables to explore: the number of rectangles and the height of each rectangle. We can explore these choices dynamically, and this applet is a particularly useful one. There we see the image shown in Figure , but with the opportunity to adjust the slider bars for the heights and the number of rectangles.   A snapshot of the applet found at gvsu.edu\/s\/a9 .    By moving the sliders, we can see how the heights of the rectangles change as we consider left endpoints, midpoints, and right endpoints, as well as the impact that a larger number of narrower rectangles has on the approximation of the exact area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis.  When on , each of the Riemann sums , , and provides an estimate of the area under the curve over the interval . We also recall that in the context of a nonnegative velocity function , the corresponding Riemann sums approximate the distance traveled on by a moving object with velocity function .  There is a more general way to think of Riemann sums, and that is to allow any choice of where the function is evaluated to determine the rectangle heights. Rather than saying we'll always choose left endpoints, or always choose midpoints, we simply say that a point will be selected at random in the interval (so that ). The Riemann sum is then given by .   The applet noted earlier and referenced in Figure , by unchecking the relative box at the top left, and instead checking random, we can easily explore the effect of using random point locations in subintervals on a Riemann sum. In computational practice, we most often use , , or , while the random Riemann sum is useful in theoretical discussions. In the following activity, we investigate several different Riemann sums for a particular velocity function.    Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity in feet per second at time in seconds given by .   Carefully sketch the region whose exact area will tell you the value of the distance the object traveled on the time interval .    Estimate the distance traveled on by computing , , and .    Does averaging and result in the same value as ? If not, what do you think the average of and measures?    For this question, think about an arbitrary function , rather than the particular function given above. If is positive and increasing on , will over-estimate or under-estimate the exact area under on ? Will over- or under-estimate the exact area under on ? Explain.          Note that is a parabola with vertex .    Recall the formulas for , , and .    Think about what the average of and measures.    Consider carefully the role of endpoints in generating and .                , , and .     .     is an under-estimate; is an over-estimate.          The region whose exact area tells us the value of the distance the object traveled on the time interval is shown below.        , , and .    The average of and is . This average actually measures what would result from using four trapezoids, rather than rectangles, to estimate the area on each subinterval. One reason this is so is because the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the width, and the bases are given by the function values at the left and right endpoints.    If is positive and increasing on , will under-estimate the exact area under on . Because is increasing, its value at the left endpoint of any subinterval will be lower than every other function value in the interval, and thus the rectangle with that height lies exclusively below the curve. In a similar way, over-estimates the exact area under on .         When the function is sometimes negative  For a Riemann sum such as , we can of course compute the sum even when takes on negative values. We know that when is positive on , a Riemann sum estimates the area bounded between and the horizontal axis over the interval.   At left and center, two left Riemann sums for a function that is sometimes negative; at right, the areas bounded by on the interval .    For the function pictured in the first graph of Figure , a left Riemann sum with 12 subintervals over is shown. The function is negative on the interval , so at the four left endpoints that fall in , the terms are negative. This means that those four terms in the Riemann sum produce an estimate of the opposite of the area bounded by and the -axis on .  In the middle graph of Figure , we see that by increasing the number of rectangles the approximation of the area (or the opposite of the area) bounded by the curve appears to improve.  In general, any Riemann sum of a continuous function on an interval approximates the difference between the area that lies above the horizontal axis on and under and the area that lies below the horizontal axis on and above . In the notation of Figure , we may say that , where is the left Riemann sum using 24 subintervals shown in the middle graph. and are the areas of the regions where is positive, and is the area where is negative. We will call the quantity the net signed area  net signed area bounded by over the interval , where by the phrase signed area we indicate that we are attaching a minus sign to the areas of regions that fall below the horizontal axis.  Finally, we recall that if the function represents the velocity of a moving object, the sum of the areas bounded by the curve tells us the total distance traveled over the relevant time interval, while the net signed area bounded by the curve computes the object's change in position on the interval.    Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity (in feet per second) at time (in seconds) given by .   Compute , the middle Riemann sum, for on the time interval . Be sure to clearly identify the value of as well as the locations of , , , . In addition, provide a careful sketch of the function and the corresponding rectangles that are being used in the sum.    Building on your work in (a), estimate the total change in position of the object on the interval .    Building on your work in (a) and (b), estimate the total distance traveled by the object on .    Use appropriate computing technology For instance, consider the applet and change the function and adjust the locations of the blue points that represent the interval endpoints and . to compute and . What exact value do you think the middle sum eventually approaches as increases without bound? What does that number represent in the physical context of the overall problem?          Note that .    Change in position is tied to the net signed area bounded by the velocity function.    Think about how total distance is different from change in position when the velocity is sometimes negative.    Besides the noted applet, computer algebra systems such as Maple and Mathematica offer this utility.                  The change in position is approximately feet.     .     is the object's total change in position on .          For this Riemann sum with five subintervals, , so , , , , and . It follows that A sketch is shown below.       Since the net signed area bounded by on represents the total change in position of the object on the interval , it follows that estimates the total change in position. Hence, the change in position is approximately feet.    To estimate the total distance traveled by the object on , we have to calculate the total area between the curve and the -axis. Thus, .    Using appropriate technology, and . Further calculations suggest that as , and this number represents the object's total change in position on .         Summary     A Riemann sum is simply a sum of products of the form that estimates the area between a positive function and the horizontal axis over a given interval. If the function is sometimes negative on the interval, the Riemann sum estimates the difference between the areas that lie above the horizontal axis and those that lie below the axis.    The three most common types of Riemann sums are left, right, and middle sums, but we can also work with a more general Riemann sum. The only difference among these sums is the location of the point at which the function is evaluated to determine the height of the rectangle whose area is being computed. For a left Riemann sum, we evaluate the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval, while for right and middle sums, we use right endpoints and midpoints, respectively.    The left, right, and middle Riemann sums are denoted , , and , with formulas , where , , and , using . For the midpoint sum, .

Your sketch looks something like the black curve in the graph below.       Left endpoint approximation    You decide to use a left endpoint Riemann sum to estimate the total displacement. So, you pick up a blue pen and draw rectangles whose height is determined by the velocity measurement at the left endpoint of each one-second interval. By using the left endpoint Riemann sum as an approximation, you are assuming that the actual velocity is approximately constant on each one-second interval (or, equivalently, that the actual acceleration is approximately zero on each one-second interval), and that the velocity and acceleration have discontinuous jumps every second. This assumption is probably incorrect because it is likely that the velocity and acceleration change continuously over time. However, you decide to use this approximation anyway since it seems like a reasonable approximation to the actual velocity given the limited amount of data.  (A) Using the left endpoint Riemann sum, find approximately how far the object traveled. Your answers must include the correct help (units) .  Total displacement =  Total distance traveled =  Using the same data, you also decide to estimate how far the object traveled using a right endpoint Riemann sum. So, you sketch the curve again with a black pen, and draw rectangles whose height is determined by the velocity measurement at the right endpoint of each one-second interval.       Right endpoint approximation    (B) Using the right endpoint Riemann sum, find approximately how far the object traveled. Your answers must include the correct help (units) .  Total displacement =  Total distance traveled =                       Solution: Using the left endpoint Riemann sum, the total displacement is the net area of the light blue shaded rectangles, and the total distance is the absolute area of the light blue shaded rectangles. Total displacement = feet. Total distance = feet. We can also make similar calculations using the right endpoint Riemann sum. Total displacement = feet. Total distance = feet.      Writing basic Riemann sums   On a sketch of , represent the left Riemann sum with approximating . Write out the terms of the sum, but do not evaluate it:  Sum = +  On another sketch, represent the right Riemann sum with approximating . Write out the terms of the sum, but do not evaluate it:  Sum = +  Which sum is an overestimate?   the left Riemann sum    the right Riemann sum    neither sum    Which sum is an underestimate?   the right Riemann sum    the left Riemann sum    neither sum                         , which is where the function is drawn with a heavy line.       left sum  right sum   Thus we can see that the left Riemann sum is given by and the right Riemann sum by From the sketches we can see that the right Riemann sum is an overestimate and the left Riemann sum an underestimate.         Consider the function .   Compute for on the interval . Be sure to clearly identify the value of , as well as the locations of . Include a careful sketch of the function and the corresponding rectangles being used in the sum.    Use a familiar geometric formula to determine the exact value of the area of the region bounded by and the -axis on .    Explain why the values you computed in (a) and (b) turn out to be the same. Will this be true if we use a number different than and compute ? Will or have the same value as the exact area of the region found in (b)?    Describe the collection of functions for which it will always be the case that , regardless of the value of , gives the exact net signed area bounded between the function and the -axis on the interval .          .        .    The rectangles with heights that come from the midpoint have the same area as the trapezoids that are formed by the function values at the two endpoints of each subinterval.      will give the exact area for any value of . Neither nor will be exact for any .    For any linear function of the form such that on the interval of interest.         Since we are using subintervals on , it follows that . Thus, , , , , and . The midpoints of the respective subintervals are thus , , , and . Thus, An overall sketch of the key parts of is seen in the figure below.       Observe that and . The region bounded by the function, the -axis, and the endpoints is a trapezoid. Recalling that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height, we see that the bounded region has area .    The reason that gives the exact area between the line and the -axis is the rectangles with heights that come from the midpoint have the same area as the trapezoids that are formed by the function values at the two endpoints of each subinterval. We can also see this by observing that the ``extra area'' bounded by the midpoint rectangle exactly matches the ``missing area'' that is absent from the midpoint rectangle, as seen in the following figure. Since these two quantities balance out, the areas of the midpoint rectangles give us the exact area under the curve.     Indeed, the value of will give the exact area under on for any value of . But neither nor will be exact: will underestimate the true area since every rectangle will lie completely under the function , whereas will overestimate because every rectangle lies above the function.    For any linear function of the form such that on the interval of interest, the midpoint rule will give the exact value of the area bounded by the function and the -axis. This is true because the area of the trapezoid formed by the two endpoints on a given subinterval will be the same as the area of the rectangle whose height is given by the function at the midpoint of the subinterval.       Let be the sum given by .   Assume that is a right Riemann sum. For what function and what interval is this function's Riemann sum? Why?    How does your answer to (a) change if is a left Riemann sum? a middle Riemann sum?    Suppose that really is a right Riemann sum. What is geometric quantity does approximate?    Use sigma notation to write a new sum that is the right Riemann sum for the same function, but that uses twice as many subintervals as .          on the interval .    If is a left Riemann sum, on the interval . If is a middle Riemann sum, on the interval .    The area under on .     .         The function is being evaluated at , , , , and . Thus, since we know this is a right Riemann sum, we are using subintervals with , and . From the pattern, we observe that the function must be on the interval .    If is a left Riemann sum instead, then the 's shift left: , , , . In this setting, the function is identical, but we are considering it on the interval .  If is a middle Riemann sum, then (for example) is the midpoint of an interval units long, so and . Continuing that trend, we'd be considering the function on the interval .     is an approximation of the area that lies under on .

What is the definition of the definite integral of a function over the interval ?    What does the definite integral measure exactly, and what are some of the key properties of the definite integral?

At left and center, two left Riemann sums for a function that is sometimes negative; at right, the exact areas bounded by on the interval .    We therefore explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound. In an effort to compute the exact net signed area we also consider the differences among left, right, and middle Riemann sums and the different results they generate as the value of increases. We begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.   Consider this applet , in which you will initially see the situation shown in Figure .

More information on how to pan and zoom is available .  Work accordingly to adjust the applet so that it uses a left Riemann sum with subintervals for the function is .

Update the applet (and view window, as needed) so that the function being considered is on , as directed above. For this function on this interval, compute , , for , , and . What appears to be the exact area bounded by and the -axis on ?    Use basic geometry to determine the exact area bounded by and the -axis on .    Based on your work in (a) and (b), what do you observe occurs when we increase the number of subintervals used in the Riemann sum?    Update the applet to consider the function on the interval (note that you need to enter x ^ 2 + 1 for the function formula). Use the applet to compute , , for , , and . What do you conjecture is the exact area bounded by and the -axis on ?    Why can we not compute the exact value of the area bounded by and the -axis on using a formula like we did in (b)?      A left Riemann sum with 5 subintervals for the function on the interval . The value of the sum is .       The definition of the definite integral  definite integral definition  In Preview Activity , we saw that as the number of rectangles got larger and larger, the values of , , and all grew closer and closer to the same value. It turns out that this occurs for any continuous function on an interval , and also for a Riemann sum using any point in the interval . Thus, as we let , it doesn't really matter where we choose to evaluate the function within a given subinterval, because .  That these limits always exist (and share the same value) when is continuous It turns out that a function need not be continuous in order to have a definite integral. For our purposes, we assume that the functions we consider are continuous on the interval(s) of interest. It is straightforward to see that any function that is piecewise continuous on an interval of interest will also have a well-defined definite integral. allows us to make the following definition.   definite integral definition   The definite integral of a continuous function on the interval , denoted , is the real number given by , where , (for ), and satisfies (for ).    We call the symbol the integral sign , integral sign the values and the limits of integration , limits of integration and the function the integrand . integrand The process of determining the real number is called evaluating the definite integral . While there are several different interpretations of the definite integral, for now the most important is that measures the net signed area bounded by and the -axis on the interval .   For example, if is the function pictured in Figure , and , , and are the exact areas bounded by and the -axis on the respective intervals , , and , then .   A continuous function on the interval .     We can also use definite integrals to express the change in position and the distance traveled by a moving object. If is a velocity function on an interval , then the change in position of the object, , is given by .  If the velocity function is nonnegative on , then tells us the distance the object traveled. If the velocity is sometimes negative on , we can use definite integrals to find the areas bounded by the function on each interval where does not change sign, and the sum of these areas will tell us the distance the object traveled.  To compute the value of a definite integral from the definition, we have to take the limit of a sum. While this is possible to do in select circumstances, it is also tedious and time-consuming, and does not offer much additional insight into the meaning or interpretation of the definite integral. Instead, in Section , we will learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which provides a shortcut for evaluating a large class of definite integrals. This will enable us to determine the exact net signed area bounded by a continuous function and the -axis in many circumstances.  For now, our goal is to understand the meaning and properties of the definite integral, rather than to compute its value. To do this, we will rely on the net signed area interpretation of the definite integral. So we will use as examples curves that produce regions whose areas we can compute exactly through area formulas. We can thus compute the exact value of the corresponding integral.   For instance, if we wish to evaluate the definite integral , we observe that the region bounded by this function and the -axis is the trapezoid shown in Figure . By the formula for the area of a trapezoid, , so .   The area bounded by and the -axis on the interval .       Use known geometric formulas and the net signed area interpretation of the definite integral to evaluate each of the definite integrals below.                     , where is the function pictured in Figure . Assume that each portion of is either part of a line or part of a circle.   The function for part (d). Note that is piecewise defined, and each piece of the function is part of a circle or part of a line.            Sketch the region bounded by and the -axis on .    Sketch the region bounded by and the -axis on .    Observe that is the top half the circle whose equation is .    Use known formulas for the area of a triangle, square, or circle appropriately.           .     .     .     .          Because and the -axis bound a triangle with base of length 1 and height on the interval , it follows that .    For , we first sketch the region bounded by the function, as shown below.     The line creates two triangles, one with area and the other with area . Since the latter area corresponds to a region below the -axis, we associate a negative sign to it, and hence find that .    For , we simply observe that this function is the top half of a circle of radius 1, and thus the bounded region is a semicircle of radius 1, thus having an area of . Therefore, .    Finally, for , where is the function pictured in Figure , we consider the function on seven consecutive subintervals of length 1. Observe that on , the bounded area is . On , the area is . Similarly, on the next five subintervals of length 1, the areas bounded are respectively , , , , and . Thus, the value of the integral is , which is approximately 0.8562.         Some properties of the definite integral  Regarding the definite integral of a function over an interval as the net signed area bounded by and the -axis, we discover several standard properties of the definite integral. It is helpful to remember that the definite integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums, which consist of the areas of rectangles.  For any real number and the definite integral it is evident that no area is enclosed, because the interval begins and ends with the same point. Hence,   If is a continuous function and is a real number, then .    Next, we consider the result of subdividing the interval of integration. In Figure , we see that , which illustrates the following general rule.   The area bounded by on the interval .      If is a continuous function and , , and are real numbers, then .   While this rule is easy to see if , it in fact holds in general for any values of , , and . Another property of the definite integral states that if we reverse the order of the limits of integration, we change the sign of the integral's value.   If is a continuous function and and are real numbers, then .   This result makes sense because if we integrate from to , then in the defining Riemann sum we set , while if we integrate from to , we have , and this is the only change in the sum used to define the integral.  There are two additional useful properties of the definite integral. When we worked with derivative rules in Chapter , we formulated the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule. Recall that the Constant Multiple Rule says that if is a differentiable function and is a constant, then , and the Sum Rule says that if and are differentiable functions, then .  These rules are useful because they allow to deal individually with the simplest parts of certain functions by taking advantage of addition and multiplying by a constant. In other words, the process of taking the derivative respects addition and multiplying by constants in the simplest possible way.  It turns out that similar rules hold for the definite integral. First, let's consider the functions pictured in Figure .   The areas bounded by and on .    Because multiplying the function by 2 doubles its height at every -value, we see that the height of each rectangle in a left Riemann sum is doubled, for the original function, versus in the doubled function. For the areas and , it follows . As this is true regardless of the value of or the type of sum we use, we see that in the limit, the area of the red region bounded by will be twice the area of the blue region bounded by . As there is nothing special about the value compared to an arbitrary constant , the following general principle holds.   Constant Multiple Rule  definite integral constant multiple rule  If is a continuous function and is any real number, then .   We see a similar situation with the sum of two functions and .   The areas bounded by and on , as well as the area bounded by .    If we take the sum of two functions and at every point in the interval, the height of the function is given by . Hence, for the pictured rectangles with areas , , and , it follows that . Because this will occur for every such rectangle, in the limit the area of the gray region will be the sum of the areas of the blue and red regions. In terms of definite integrals, we have the following general rule.   Sum Rule  definite integral sum rule  If and are continuous functions, then .   The Constant Multiple and Sum Rules can be combined to say that for any continuous functions and and any constants and , .    Suppose that the following information is known about the functions , , , and :    ;      ;      ;      ;      Use the provided information and the rules discussed in the preceding section to evaluate each of the following definite integrals.                                  Note that the value of is given.    Use the values of and .    First find and .    Use the sum and constant multiple rules.    First write .           .     .     .     .     .          Note that the value of is given, and thus .    Since and , we have .    First, using work from and similar to that in (c), we find and , thus by the sum rule, .    By the sum and constant multiple rules, .    First, we write . Then, using the sum and constant multiple rules, it follows .         How the definite integral is connected to a function's average value  average value of a function  One of the most valuable applications of the definite integral is that it provides a way to discuss the average value of a function, even for a function that takes on infinitely many values. Recall that if we wish to take the average of numbers , , , , we compute .  Since integrals arise from Riemann sums in which we add values of a function, it should not be surprising that evaluating an integral is similar to averaging the output values of a function. Consider, for instance, the right Riemann sum of a function , which is given by .  Since , we can thus write .  We see that the right Riemann sum with subintervals is just the length of the interval times the average of the function values found at the right endpoints. And just as with our efforts to compute area, the larger the value of we use, the more accurate our average will be. Indeed, we will define the average value of on to be .  But we also know that for any continuous function on , taking the limit of a Riemann sum leads precisely to the definite integral. That is, , and thus taking the limit as in Equation , we have that .  Solving Equation for , we have the following general principle.   Average value of a function   average value If is a continuous function on , then its average value on is given by the formula .   Equation tells us another way to interpret the definite integral: the definite integral of a function from to is the length of the interval times the average value of the function on the interval. In addition, when the function is nonnegative on , Equation has a natural visual interpretation.   A function , the area it bounds, and its average value on .    Consider Figure , where we see at left the shaded region whose area is , at center the shaded rectangle whose dimensions are by , and at right these two figures superimposed. Note that in dark green we show the horizontal line . Thus, the area of the green rectangle is given by , which is precisely the value of . The area of the blue region in the left figure is the same as the area of the green rectangle in the center figure. We can also observe that the areas and in the rightmost figure appear to be equal. Thus, knowing the average value of a function enables us to construct a rectangle whose area is the same as the value of the definite integral of the function on the interval. This applet provides an opportunity to explore how the average value of the function changes as the interval changes, through an image similar to that found in Figure .    Suppose that tells us the instantaneous velocity of a moving object on the interval , where is measured in minutes and is measured in meters per minute.   Sketch an accurate graph of . What kind of curve is ?    Evaluate exactly.    In terms of the physical problem of the moving object with velocity , what is the meaning of ? Include units on your answer.    Determine the exact average value of on . Include units on your answer.    Sketch a rectangle whose base is the line segment from to on the -axis such that the rectangle's area is equal to the value of . What is the rectangle's exact height?    How can you use the average value you found in (d) to compute the total distance traveled by the moving object over ?          Note that is part of the curve given by .    What familiar shape is generated by the curve ?    Recall the meaning of the area bounded by a nonnegative velocity function on a given interval.    From the meaning of the average value of a function, we know .    Consider a key recent figure in the text.    Distance equals average rate times .           is the top half of the circle , which has radius 2 and is centered at .     .    The object moved meters in 4 minutes.     , meters per minute,.       The height of the rectangle is the average value of , .     .          The curve is the top half of the circle , which has radius 2 and is centered at .    Thus, the value of is the area of a semicircle of radius 2, which is .    Because the velocity is always nonnegative in this problem, the meaning of is both the distance traveled and the change in position of the object on the interval . Specifically, the object moved meters in 4 minutes.    We know , so , which is measured in meters per minute, since the units on 4 are minutes and on are meters.    Constructing a figure similar to those shown in this section on the topic of average value of a function, we find the following, which demonstrates a rectangle having the same area as the semicircle.     The height of the rectangle is the average value of , specifically .    Knowing that average velocity is , it follows from the fact that distance traveled equals average rate times time (provided velocity is always nonnegative), we have . We see from (c) or (f) that we are simply considering the situation from two different perspectives: if we know the distance traveled, we can find average velocity, or if we know average velocity, we can find distance traveled.         Summary     Any Riemann sum of a continuous function on an interval provides an estimate of the net signed area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis on the interval. Increasing the number of subintervals in the Riemann sum improves the accuracy of this estimate, and letting the number of subintervals increase without bound results in the values of the corresponding Riemann sums approaching the exact value of the enclosed net signed area.    When we take the limit of Riemann sums, we arrive at what we call the definite integral of over the interval . In particular, the symbol denotes the definite integral of over , and this quantity is defined by the equation , where , (for ), and satisfies (for ).    The definite integral measures the exact net signed area bounded by and the horizontal axis on ; in addition, the value of the definite integral is related to what we call the average value of the function on : . In the setting where we consider the integral of a velocity function , measures the exact change in position of the moving object on ; when is nonnegative, is the object's distance traveled on .    The definite integral is a sophisticated sum, and thus has some of the same natural properties that finite sums have. Perhaps most important of these is how the definite integral respects sums and constant multiples of functions, which can be summarized by the rule where and are continuous functions on and and are arbitrary constants.       Evaluating definite integrals from graphical information   Use the following figure, which shows a graph of to find each of the indicated integrals.   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  Note that the first area (with vertical, red shading) is 18 and the second (with oblique, black shading) is 6.  A.    B.    C.    D.                         and the -axis, with area below the axis being counted as negative area. Therefore , , , and .      Estimating definite integrals from a graph   Use the graph of shown below to find the following integrals.   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  A.    B. If the vertical red shaded area in the graph has area , estimate:   (Your estimate may be written in terms of .)             -axis for the values given in in the integral, we have In this case the area is negative because it lies below the -axis. For the second integral, note that the negative area between and is exactly equal to the positive area between and , so that all that is left is the area of the shaded area. Thus,       Finding the average value of a linear function   Find the average value of over  average value =        on . The integral is the area under the curve, which is a trapezoidal area. So the average value is       Finding the average value of a function given graphically   The figure below to the left is a graph of , and below to the right is .            (a)  What is the average value of on ?  avg value =  (b)  What is the average value of on ?  avg value =  (c)  What is the average value of on ?  avg value =  (d)  Is the following statement true?    Yes    No                    and as the area under the curves and dividing by the length of the interval, which is 2. This gives us: , and . However, when we find , we find that the product is everywhere zero! is zero for , so is zero there, and is zero for , so is zero there too. Thus the average value of the product is zero, and the average of the product is not equal to the product of the averages!      Estimating a definite integral and average value from a graph   Use the figure below, which shows the graph of , to answer the following questions.   (Click on the graph to get a larger version.)  A. Estimate the integral:   (You will certainly want to use an enlarged version of the graph to obtain your estimate.)  B. Which of the following average values of is larger?    Between and    Between and          A. The integral is the area above the -axis minus the area below the -axis. Thus, we can see that is about . To determine which average value of is largest, we consider the areas and . If the first (divided by six) is greater than the second (divided by 3), the average value over the first is larger than that over the second. Here, the interval gives the largest average value.      Using rules to combine known integral values   Suppose .                      The velocity of an object moving along an axis is given by the piecewise linear function that is pictured in Figure . Assume that the object is moving to the right when its velocity is positive, and moving to the left when its velocity is negative. Assume that the given velocity function is valid for to .      Write an expression involving definite integrals whose value is the total change in position of the object on the interval .    Use the provided graph of to determine the value of the total change in position on .    Write an expression involving definite integrals whose value is the total distance traveled by the object on . What is the exact value of the total distance traveled on ?    What is the object's exact average velocity on ?    Find an algebraic formula for the object's position function on that satisfies .      The velocity function of a moving object.         The total change in position is .     feet.     feet.     feet per second.     .         Since the area between the velocity function and the -axis tells us distance traveled (provided we are careful about velocity being negative), we can use definite integrals to express the total change in position.  The change in position on is , and the value of this integral is positive since velocity is positive. The change in position on is , and the value of this integral is negative since the velocity is negative. Finally, the change in position on is , which is positive. Thus, the total change in position, , is . By the additive property of definite integrals, the total change in position is .    We can evaluate the three integrals identified in (a) by finding the areas of relevant triangles since the velocity function is piecewise linear. In particular, , , and . Thus, the total change in position is feet.    For the total distance traveled, , we take the opposite of the change in position on any interval where the velocity is negative. Hence, feet.    Recall that the average value of a function on an interval is . So the average velocity, , of the object on the interval is feet per second.    Assuming that is linear on the interval , the slope of is . Given that the -intercept is we conclude that on the interval we have . Now position, , is an antiderivative of the velocity, , so the possible formulas for on the interval are , where is some constant. If we want , that forces and so the object's position function on that satisfies is .       Suppose that the velocity of a moving object is given by , measured in feet per second, and that this function is valid for .   Write an expression involving definite integrals whose value is the total change in position of the object on the interval .    Use appropriate technology (such as an applet ) to compute Riemann sums to estimate the object's total change in position on . Work to ensure that your estimate is accurate to two decimal places, and explain how you know this to be the case.    Write an expression involving definite integrals whose value is the total distance traveled by the object on .    Use appropriate technology to compute Riemann sums to estimate the object's total distance travelled on . Work to ensure that your estimate is accurate to two decimal places, and explain how you know this to be the case.    What is the object's average velocity on , accurate to two decimal places?         The total change in position, , is .     .    The total distance traveled, , is .     .     feet per second.         We observe that at , , and , and is positive on the intervals and , while is negative on . The total change in position, , of the object is thus given by .    Using computational technology, we use the midpoint rule to estimate the total change of position, . We find that , , , and . Since it appears that neither of the first two decimal places are changing as we increase the number of subintervals, it looks like is accurate to two decimal places.    We noted in (a) where is positive and negative. In particular, on , , and thus will give us a negative change in position; the distance traveled on this interval is therefore , and hence the total distance traveled, , on is .    To use Riemann sums to estimate , we have to estimate each of the three integrals individually. We find that    ,     , and        From experimenting with different -values in , it is apparent that each of these individual estimates is accurate to at least decimal places, and thus we expect their sum to be accurate to at least . Hence, . Therefore is an estimate of distance traveled accurate to at least decimal places.    We know that the average velocity on is given by the integral expression . We estimated the definite integral in (b), so using that result, feet per second is the object's average velocity, accurate to at least two decimal places. It makes sense that the average velocity is positive since the total change in position is positive.       Consider the graphs of two functions and that are provided in Figure . Each piece of and is either part of a straight line or part of a circle.   Two functions and .       Determine the exact value of .    Determine the exact value of .    Find the exact average value of on .    For what constant does the following equation hold?           .     .     .     .         The sum property of the definite integral tells us that Now is the area of a triangle of height and base , so . Also, is the opposite of the area of a quarter circle of radius , so . Therefore, .    The value of is the difference of the areas of the regions bounds above the -axis minus the areas of the regions bounds below the -axis on the interval . The area of the triangle bounds above the -axis on the interval is , the area of the region bounds below the -axis on is also , the area of the region bounds below the -axis on is the area ( ) of a rectangle with height and base , and the area of the region bounds below the -axis on is the area ( ) of a triangle with height and base . So . Notice that the graph of is linear on the interval , passing through the points and . This line has slope and equation . The -intercept of this line is . So the triangle the graph of bounds on the interval has area , and the area of the triangle between the graph of and the -axis on the interval is . Finally, the graph of bounds a quarter circle of radius on the interval , so . Therefore, .    Recall that the average value of a function on an interval is . Combining the results from (a) and (b) gives us and . Thus, the average value of on the interval is .    We know that is the signed area of a rectangle with ``height\" (note that could be negative), and base , so . Also, from part (c) we have . Therefore, from which it follows that so .       Let and .   On the interval , sketch a labeled graph of and write a definite integral whose value is the exact area bounded by on .    On the interval , sketch a labeled graph of and write a definite integral whose value is the exact area bounded by on .    Write an expression involving a difference of definite integrals whose value is the exact area that lies between and on .    Explain why your expression in (c) has the same value as the single integral .    Explain why, in general, if for all in , the exact area between and is given by .          .        .       The exact area between the two curves is .    Use the sum rule for definite integrals over the same interval.    Think about subtracting the area under from the area under .         Since is positive on , the area bounded by the function and -axis on the given interval is . A sketch of the function and region is shown below.       Likewise, because is positive on , the area bounded by the function and -axis on the given interval is . A sketch of the function and region is shown below.       From the above two figures, we see that the exact area between the two curves is the area under ( ) minus the area under ( ). That is, .    By the sum rule for definite integrals over the same interval, we know that and thus the latter single integral captures the exact area between the two curves on .    In general, if on , the exact area, , between and on the interval will be given by because we can find the area as the difference of the area under ( ) and the area under ( ), and then subtract the two definite integrals as shown in (d).

  "body": " The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus     How can we find the exact value of a definite integral without taking the limit of a Riemann sum?    What is the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and how do antiderivatives of functions play a key role in applying the theorem?    What is the meaning of the definite integral of a rate of change in contexts other than when the rate of change represents velocity?      Much of our work in Chapter has been motivated by the velocity-distance problem: if we know the instantaneous velocity function, , for a moving object on a given time interval , can we determine the distance it traveled on ? If the velocity function is nonnegative on , the area bounded by and the -axis on is equal to the distance traveled. This area is also the value of the definite integral . If the velocity is sometimes negative, the total area bounded by the velocity function still tells us distance traveled, while the net signed area tells us the object's change in position.  For instance, for the velocity function in Figure , the total distance traveled by the moving object on is , and the total change in the object's position is . The areas , , and are each given by definite integrals, which may be computed by limits of Riemann sums (and in special circumstances by geometric formulas).   A velocity function that is sometimes negative.    We turn our attention to an alternate approach.   A student with a third floor dormitory window 32 feet off the ground tosses a water balloon straight up in the air with an initial velocity of 16 feet per second. It turns out that the instantaneous velocity of the water balloon is given by , where is measured in feet per second and is measured in seconds.   Let represent the height of the water balloon above ground at time , and note that is an antiderivative of . That is, is the derivative of : . Find a formula for that satisfies the initial condition that the balloon is tossed from 32 feet above ground. In other words, make your formula for satisfy .    When does the water balloon reach its maximum height? When does it land?    Compute , , and . What do these represent?    What is the total vertical distance traveled by the water balloon from the time it is tossed until the time it lands?    Sketch a graph of the velocity function on the time interval . What is the total net signed area bounded by and the -axis on ? Answer this question in two ways: first by using your work above, and then by using a familiar geometric formula to compute areas of certain relevant regions.        The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  fundamental theorem of calculus  Suppose we know the position function and the velocity function of an object moving in a straight line, and for the moment let us assume that is positive on . Then, as shown in Figure , we know two different ways to compute the distance, , the object travels: one is that , the object's change in position. The other is the area under the velocity curve, which is given by the definite integral, so .   Finding distance traveled when we know a velocity function .    Since both of these expressions tell us the distance traveled, it follows that they are equal, so .   Equation holds even when velocity is sometimes negative, because ,the object's change in position, is also measured by the net signed area on which is given by .  Perhaps the most powerful fact Equation reveals is that we can compute the integral's value if we can find a formula for . Remember, and are related by the fact that is the derivative of , or equivalently that is an antiderivative of .    Determine the exact distance traveled on by an object with velocity function feet per second. The distance traveled on the interval is given by , where is an antiderivative of . Now, the derivative of is and the derivative of is , so it follows that is an antiderivative of . Therefore, .    Note the key lesson of Example : to find the distance traveled, we need to compute the area under a curve, which is given by the definite integral. But to evaluate the integral, we can find an antiderivative, , of the velocity function, and then compute the total change in on the interval. In particular, we can evaluate the integral without computing the limit of a Riemann sum.   The exact area of the region enclosed by on .    It will be convenient to have a shorthand symbol for a function's antiderivative. For a continuous function , we will often denote an antiderivative of by , so that for all relevant . Using the notation in place of (so that is an antiderivative of ) in Equation , we can write .  Now, to evaluate the definite integral for an arbitrary continuous function , we could certainly think of as representing the velocity of some moving object, and as the variable that represents time. But Equations and hold for any continuous velocity function, even when is sometimes negative. So Equation offers a shortcut route to evaluating any definite integral, provided that we can find an antiderivative of the integrand. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) FTC summarizes these observations.   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   fundamental theorem of calculus If is a continuous function on , and is any antiderivative of , then .   A common alternate notation for is , where we read the righthand side as the function evaluated from to . In this notation, the FTC says that .  The FTC opens the door to evaluating a wide range of integrals if we can find an antiderivative for the integrand . For instance since , the FTC tells us that .  But finding an antiderivative can be far from simple; it is often difficult or even impossible. While we can differentiate just about any function, even some relatively simple functions don't have an elementary antiderivative. A significant portion of integral calculus (which is the main focus of second semester college calculus) is devoted to the problem of finding antiderivatives.    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate each of the following integrals exactly. For each, sketch a graph of the integrand on the relevant interval and write one sentence that explains the meaning of the value of the integral in terms of the (net signed) area bounded by the curve.                                  Find a function whose derivative is .    Which familiar function has derivative ?    What is special about when it comes to differentiation?    Consider the derivative of .    Find an antiderivative for each of the three individual terms in the integrand.           .     .     .     .     .          Because , by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, , and therefore .    Since , an antiderivative of is . Therefore, by the FTC, , so .    Since is its own derivative, it is also its own antiderivative. Hence, .    Note that since , it follows that , and thus .    Using the sum and constant multiple rules for differentiation, we can see that similar results hold for antidifferentiation, and thus that is an antiderivative of . Now, by the FTC, .         Basic antiderivatives  The general problem of finding an antiderivative is difficult. In part, this is due to the fact that we are trying to undo the process of differentiating, and the undoing is much more difficult than the doing. For example, while it is evident that an antiderivative of is and that an antiderivative of is , combinations of and can be far more complicated. Consider the functions .  What is involved in trying to find an antiderivative for each? From our experience with derivative rules, we know that derivatives of sums and constant multiples of basic functions are simple to execute, but derivatives involving products, quotients, and composites of familiar functions are more complicated. Therefore, it stands to reason that antidifferentiating products, quotients, and composites of basic functions may be even more challenging. We defer our study of all but the most elementary antiderivatives to later in the text.  We do note that whenever we know the derivative of a function, we have a function-derivative pair , so we also know the antiderivative of a function. For instance, since we know that , we also know that is an antiderivative of . and together form a function-derivative pair. Clearly, every basic derivative rule leads us to such a pair, and thus to a known antiderivative.  In Activity , we will construct a list of the basic antiderivatives we know at this time. Those rules will help us antidifferentiate sums and constant multiples of basic functions. For example, since is an antiderivative of and is an antiderivative of , it follows that is an antiderivative of , by the sum and constant multiple rules for differentiation.  Finally, before proceeding to build a list of common functions whose antiderivatives we know, we recall that each function has more than one antiderivative. Because the derivative of any constant is zero, we may add a constant of our choice to any antiderivative. For instance, we know that is an antiderivative of . But we could also have chosen , since in this case as well, . If , we say that the general antiderivative  antiderivative general of is , where represents an arbitrary real number constant. Regardless of the formula for , including in the formula for its antiderivative results in the most general possible antiderivative.  Our current interest in antiderivatives is so that we can evaluate definite integrals by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. For that task, the constant is irrelevant, and we usually omit it. To see why, consider the definite integral .  For the integrand , suppose we find and use the general antiderivative . Then, by the FTC, .  Observe that the -values appear as opposites in the evaluation of the integral and thus do not affect the definite integral's value.  In the following activity, we work to build a list of basic functions whose antiderivatives we already know.    Use your knowledge of derivatives of basic functions to complete Table of antiderivatives. For each entry, your task is to find a function whose derivative is the given function . When finished, use the FTC and the results in the table to evaluate the three given definite integrals.   Familiar basic functions and their antiderivatives.    given function,  antiderivative,     , ( is constant)     ,     ,                                                                    For the table, you might start by constructing a list of all the basic functions whose derivative you know. For the three definite integrals, be sure to recall the sum and constant multiple rules, which work not only for differentiating, but also for antidifferentiating.       given function,  antiderivative,     , ( )     ,     ,                                                   .     .     .          given function,  antiderivative,     , ( )     ,     ,                                                  By standard antiderivative rules and the FTC, .    Calculating the needed antiderivative and applying the FTC, .    Noting that , we find that .         The total change theorem  total change theorem  Let us review three interpretations of the definite integral.   For a moving object with instantaneous velocity , the object's change in position on the time interval is given by , and whenever on , tells us the total distance traveled by the object on .    For any continuous function , its definite integral represents the net signed area bounded by and the -axis on , where regions that lie below the -axis have a minus sign associated with their area.    The value of a definite integral is linked to the average value of a function: for a continuous function on , its average value is given by .     The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus now enables us to evaluate exactly (without taking a limit of Riemann sums) any definite integral for which we are able to find an antiderivative of the integrand.  A slight change in perspective allows us to gain even more insight into the meaning of the definite integral. Recall Equation , where we wrote the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for a velocity function with antiderivative as .  If we instead replace with (which represents position) and replace with (since velocity is the derivative of position), Equation then reads as .  In words, this version of the FTC tells us that the total change in an object's position function on a particular interval is given by the definite integral of the position function's derivative over that interval.  Of course, this result is not limited to only the setting of position and velocity. Writing the result in terms of a more general function , we have the Total Change Theorem.   Total Change Theorem   total change theorem If is a continuously differentiable function on with derivative , then . That is, the definite integral of the rate of change of a function on is the total change of the function itself on .   The Total Change Theorem tells us more about the relationship between the graph of a function and that of its derivative. Recall that heights on the graph of the derivative function are equal to slopes on the graph of the function itself. If instead we know and are seeking information about , we can say the following:    differences in heights on correspond to net signed areas bounded by .     The graphs of (at left) and an antiderivative at right. Differences in heights on correspond to net signed areas bounded by .    To see why this is so, consider the difference . This value is 3, because and , but also because the net signed area bounded by on is 3. That is, .  In addition to this observation about area, the Total Change Theorem enables us to answer questions about a function whose rate of change we know.    Suppose that pollutants are leaking out of an underground storage tank at a rate of gallons\/day, where is measured in days. It is conjectured that is given by the formula over a certain 12-day period. The graph of is given in Figure . What is the meaning of and what is its value? What is the average rate at which pollutants are leaving the tank on the time interval ?   The rate of pollution leaking from a tank, measured in gallons per day.      Since , the value of is the area under the curve on the interval . A Riemann sum for this area will have rectangles with heights measured in gallons per day and widths measured in days, so the area of each rectangle will have units of .  Thus, the definite integral tells us the total number of gallons of pollutant that leak from the tank from day 4 to day 10. The Total Change Theorem tells us the same thing: if we let denote the total number of gallons of pollutant that have leaked from the tank up to day , then , and , the number of gallons that have leaked from day 4 to day 10.  To compute the exact value of the integral, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Antidifferentiating , we find that .  Thus, approximately 44.282 gallons of pollutant leaked over the six day time period.  To find the average rate at which pollutant leaked from the tank over , we compute the average value of on . Thus, gallons per day.      During a 40-minute workout, a person riding an exercise machine burns calories at a rate of calories per minute, where the function is given in Figure . On the interval , the formula for is , while on , its formula is .   The rate at which a person exercising burns calories, measured in calories per minute.       What is the exact total number of calories the person burns during the first 10 minutes of her workout?    Let be an antiderivative of . What is the meaning of in the context of the person exercising? Include units on your answer.    Determine the exact average rate at which the person burned calories during the 40-minute workout.    At what time(s), if any, is the instantaneous rate at which the person is burning calories equal to the average rate at which she burns calories, on the time interval ?          What are the units on the area of a rectangle found in a Riemann sum for the function ?    Use the FTC.    Recall the formula for .    Think carefully about which function tells you the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned.          The person burned exactly calories in the first 10 minutes of the workout.     is the total calories burned on .    The exact average rate at which the person burned calories on is .    One time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on is .          Since the units on a rectangle in a Riemann sum are cal\/min for the height and min for the width, the units on the area of such a rectangle are calories, and hence the units on area under the curve are given in total calories. Hence, the total calories burned during the first 10 minutes of the workout is given by the definite integral . We use the FTC and evaluate the integral, finding that . Thus, the person burned exactly calories in the first 10 minutes of the workout.    We observe first that by the Total Change Theorem, , and therefore, as discussed in (a), the meaning of this value is the total calories burned on .    The exact average rate at which the person burned calories on is given by . To calculate , we recognize that is defined in piecewise fashion, and use the additive property of the definite integral, which tells us that . We know from our work in (a) that . Since is constant on , it follows that . And finally, it is straightforward to show using (or symmetry) on that . Hence, . Now, it follows that the exact average rate at which calories were burned on is .    It makes sense intuitively that there must be at least one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate at which calories are burned, as it would be impossible for a continuous instantaneous rate of change to always be above its average value. Since we know from (c) that , and tells us the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned, it follows that we want to solve the equation . From the graph, it appears that there are two such values of for which this equation is true, one in the first ten minutes, and one in the last ten. For instance, solving , it follows that , only the second of which lies in . So one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on is . Similar reasoning leads to the second time that lies in .         Summary     We can find the exact value of a definite integral without taking the limit of a Riemann sum or using a familiar area formula by finding the antiderivative of the integrand, and hence applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that if is a continuous function on and is an antiderivative of , then . Hence, if we can find an antiderivative for the integrand , evaluating the definite integral comes from simply computing the change in on .    A slightly different perspective on the FTC allows us to restate it as the Total Change Theorem, which says that , for any continuously differentiable function . This means that the definite integral of the instantaneous rate of change of a function on an interval is equal to the total change in the function on .       Finding exact displacement   The velocity function is for a particle moving along a line. Find the displacement (net distance covered) of the particle during the time interval .  displacement =            Evaluating the definite integral of a rational function   The value of is        :       Evaluating the definite integral of a linear function   Evaluate the definite integral         Each part of this integral can be done separately, and each is a special case of the general rule        Evaluating the definite integral of a quadratic function   Evaluate the definite integral         Since the function is even,        Simplifying an integrand before integrating   Evaluate the definite integral         To evaluate the definite integral, we need to determine the antiderivative of the formula to be integrated. This can be done term-by-term by rewriting the integral as:   Then, we can find the derivative, which is:   Now, applying the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get the value of the definite integral as:        Evaluating the definite integral of a trigonometric function   Evaluate the definite integral         This integration can be done because we know that the derivative with respect to of is So we obtain a inside the integral, and we can then integrate to obtain Of course, since there isn t a minus sign inside the integral, we ll have to multiply inside and outside by (which doesn t change the value of course):   end{aligned}         The instantaneous velocity (in meters per minute) of a moving object is given by the function as pictured in Figure . Assume that on the interval , is given by , and that on every other interval is piecewise linear, as shown.   The velocity function of a moving body.       Determine the exact distance traveled by the object on the time interval .    What is the object's average velocity on ?    At what time is the object's acceleration greatest?    Suppose that the velocity of the object is increased by a constant value for all values of . What value of will make the object's total distance traveled on be 210 meters?          meters.     meters per minute.    The object's maximum acceleration is meters per minute per minute at the instant .     .         Since velocity is positive, distance traveled is the definite integral of velocity. Thus, on , the total distance, , is . By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, , so the distance traveled by the object on is meters.    To find the average velocity of the object on , we first evaluate . To do so, we use the fact that is piecewise linear and employ standard geometric formulas to determine the value of the integral. The area of the trapezoid formed by and the vertical line segments at and is . The area of the rectangle formed by and the vertical line segments at and is . Finally, the area of the trapezoid formed by and the vertical line segments at and is . Thus, , from which it follows that meters per minute.    To find where is greatest, we recall that , so we are seeking the location where the slope of the tangent line to is maximized on the interval . From the graph, there are only two possible intervals where this can occur: and , as these are both where is increasing and thus is positive.  On , since this is the slope of the line that forms on this interval. On , , so . We see that is a quadratic function that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex, which is located where . We know that , and implies . Moreover, . Clearly , so the object's maximum acceleration is meters per minute per minute at the instant .    Let be the new velocity function that is the original velocity increased by at every time. We want to know the value of for which total distance traveled on is meters. For this to be true, we must have that . Using the additive property of the definite integral and our earlier work in (b), we can say that , so . Since the function is constant, the integral represents the area of a rectangle units wide and units tall, so . Hence, so .       A function is given piecewise by the formula .   Determine the exact value of the net signed area enclosed by and the -axis on the interval .    Compute the exact average value of on .    Find a formula for a function on so that if we extend the above definition of so that if , it follows that .          .     .     for and on .            The net signed area enclosed by and the -axis on the interval is . The figure below shows a graph of on the interval . To calculate the definite integral of on the interval , we consider the integrals on the subintervals and . Doing so and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, .       To find the average value of on we need to first calculate . Using our work in (a) and considering the subintervals and , . Therefore, the average value of on is .    Since , we need a function that matches but that is also defined on so that . To preserve continuity, we will choose a formula for that also satisfies . It's natural to pick a linear function whose graph encloses units of area, so one that has a slope of . To check, we compute . So defined so that for and on has the desired property. A graph of is shown in the figure below.          When an aircraft attempts to climb as rapidly as possible, its climb rate (in feet per minute) decreases as altitude increases, because the air is less dense at higher altitudes. Given below is a table showing performance data for a certain single engine aircraft, giving its climb rate at various altitudes, where denotes the climb rate of the airplane at an altitude .     (feet)               (ft\/min)                Let a new function called measure the number of minutes required for a plane at altitude to climb the next foot of altitude.   Determine a similar table of values for and explain how it is related to the table above. Be sure to explain the units.    Give a careful interpretation of a function whose derivative is . Describe what the input is and what the output is. Also, explain in plain English what the function tells us.    Determine a definite integral whose value tells us exactly the number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to 10,000 feet of altitude. Clearly explain why the value of this integral has the required meaning.    Use the Riemann sum to estimate the value of the integral you found in (c). Include units on your result.            (feet)               (ft\/min)               (min\/ft)                  The antiderivative function tells the total number of minutes it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of feet.     .    It takes the plane aabout minutes.         Since the given climb rate, , is in feet per minute, and the new function, , is measured in minutes per foot, it follows that is the reciprocal of , so . Hence we get the following updated table.     (feet)               (ft\/min)               (min\/ft)                  Given an original function, we know that the units on its derivative are ``units of input per unit of output.'' Since the units on are ``minutes per foot'', it follows that the antiderivative of should have output units of ``minutes'' since its input units are ``feet''. The antiderivative function should thus tell us the total number of minutes that it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of feet.    The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral since the units on are ``minutes per foot'' and the units on in the corresponding Riemann sum are ``feet'', so when we take the product of quantities with these units, the resulting numerical quantity is measured in minutes.    For the Riemann sum , we have subintervals. Given the original data, this means that we need to evaluate the function at every other known data point. In particular, . Thus, it takes the plane a bit more than minutes to climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet.       In Chapter , we showed that for an object moving along a straight line with position function , the object's average velocity on the interval is given by .  More recently in Chapter , we found that for an object moving along a straight line with velocity function , the object's average value of its velocity function on is .  Are the average velocity on the interval and the average value of the velocity function on the same thing? Why or why not? Explain.   Yes.   Yes, . This is true because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the definitions of these two quantities. In particular, . Average velocity can be thought of in two very different ways: one as the change in position divided by change in time, the other as an average of the values of itself.    In Table in Activity , we noted that for , the antiderivative of is . Here we observe that a key difference between and is that is defined for all , while is only defined for , and see how we can actually define the antiderivative of for all values of .     Suppose that , and let . Compute .    Explain why is an antiderivative of for .    Let , and recall that . Explain why for and for .    Now discuss why we say that the antiderivative of is for all .          .    Since for those values of , .    If , then ; if , then .    For , ; for , for all .         By the chain rule, .     is an antiderivative of for since for those values of , .    If , then , while if , then .    By considering the cases of and , we see that for , and for , for all , the derivative of is , which makes the antiderivative of .       "

  "body": " When an aircraft attempts to climb as rapidly as possible, its climb rate (in feet per minute) decreases as altitude increases, because the air is less dense at higher altitudes. Given below is a table showing performance data for a certain single engine aircraft, giving its climb rate at various altitudes, where denotes the climb rate of the airplane at an altitude .     (feet)               (ft\/min)                Let a new function called measure the number of minutes required for a plane at altitude to climb the next foot of altitude.

Describe what the input is and what the output is. Also, explain in plain English what the function tells us.    Determine a definite integral whose value tells us exactly the number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to 10,000 feet of altitude. Clearly explain why the value of this integral has the required meaning.    Use the Riemann sum to estimate the value of the integral you found in (c). Include units on your result.

It takes the plane aabout minutes.         Since the given climb rate, , is in feet per minute, and the new function, , is measured in minutes per foot, it follows that is the reciprocal of , so .

(feet)               (ft\/min)               (min\/ft)                  Given an original function, we know that the units on its derivative are ``units of input per unit of output.'' Since the units on are ``minutes per foot'', it follows that the antiderivative of should have output units of ``minutes'' since its input units are ``feet''. The antiderivative function should thus tell us the total number of minutes that it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of feet.    The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral since the units on are ``minutes per foot'' and the units on in the corresponding Riemann sum are ``feet'', so when we take the product of quantities with these units, the resulting numerical quantity is measured in minutes.    For the Riemann sum , we have subintervals. Given the original data, this means that we need to evaluate the function at every other known data point. In particular, . Thus, it takes the plane a bit more than minutes to climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet.     "

  "body": " Constructing Accurate Graphs of Antiderivatives     Given the graph of a function's derivative, how can we construct a completely accurate graph of the original function?    How many antiderivatives does a given function have? What do those antiderivatives all have in common?    Given a function , how does the rule define a new function ?      A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question Given information about the derivative of an unknown function , how much information can we obtain about itself? In Activity , the graph of was known (along with the value of at a single point) and we endeavored to sketch a possible graph of near the known point. In Example  we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information about to determine where the original function is increasing and decreasing, as well as where has relative extreme values. If we know a formula or graph of , by computing we can find where the original function is concave up and concave down. Thus, knowing and enables us to understand the shape of the graph of .  We returned to this question in even more detail in Section . In that setting, we knew the instantaneous velocity of a moving object and worked to determine as much as possible about the object's position function. We found connections between the net signed area under the velocity function and the corresponding change in position of the function, and the Total Change Theorem further illuminated these connections between and , showing that the total change in the value of over an interval is determined by the net signed area bounded by and the -axis on the same interval.  In what follows, we explore the situation where we possess an accurate graph of the derivative function along with a single value of the function . From that information, we'd like to determine a graph of that shows where is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down, and also provides an accurate function value at any point.   Suppose that the following information is known about a function : the graph of its derivative, , is given in Figure . Further, assume that is piecewise linear (as pictured) and that for and , . Finally, it is given that .   At left, the graph of ; at right, axes for plotting .       On what interval(s) is an increasing function? On what intervals is decreasing?    On what interval(s) is concave up? concave down?    At what point(s) does have a relative minimum? a relative maximum?    Recall that the Total Change Theorem tells us that . What is the exact value of ?    Use the given information and similar reasoning to that in (d) to determine the exact value of , , , , and .    Based on your responses to all of the preceding questions, sketch a complete and accurate graph of on the axes provided, being sure to indicate the behavior of for and .        Constructing the graph of an antiderivative  antiderivative graph   Preview Activity demonstrates that when we can find the exact area under the graph of a function on any given interval, it is possible to construct a graph of the function's antiderivative. That is, we can find a function whose derivative is given. We can now determine not only the overall shape of the antiderivative graph, but also the actual height of the graph at any point of interest.  This is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: if we know a function and the value of the antiderivative at some starting point , we can determine the value of via the definite integral. Since , it follows that .  We can also interpret the equation in terms of the graphs of and as follows. On an interval ,    differences in heights on the graph of the antiderivative  given by  correspond to the net signed area bounded by the original function on the interval ,  which is given by  .     Suppose that the function is given by the graph shown in Figure , and that the pieces of are either portions of lines or portions of circles. In addition, let be an antiderivative of and say that . Finally, assume that for and , .   At left, the graph of .       On what interval(s) is an increasing function? On what intervals is decreasing?    On what interval(s) is concave up? concave down? neither?    At what point(s) does have a relative minimum? a relative maximum?    Use the given information to determine the exact value of for .

How (if at all) would your answers to the preceding questions change? Sketch a graph of on the same axes as the graph of you constructed in (e).          Consider the sign of .    Consider the sign of .    Where does change sign?    Recall that .    Use the function values found in (d) and the earlier information regarding the shape of .

Thus, is concave up on , , and concave down on , , and neither on .    A relative maximum for will occur wherever changes from positive to negative, and thus at ; similarly, has a relative minimum at .    Recall that , so . Similarly, . Continuing these calculations, , , , , . Furthermore, since for all and all , it follows and .    Use the function values found in (d) and the earlier information regarding the shape of .    Note that . Since (while ), this changes each response in by 1: .         Multiple antiderivatives of a single function  In the final question of Activity , we encountered a very important idea: a function has more than one antiderivative. Each antiderivative of is determined uniquely by its value at a single point. For example, suppose that is the function given at left in Figure , and suppose further that is an antiderivative of that satisfies .   At left, the graph of . At right, three different antiderivatives of .    Then, using Equation , we can compute . Similarly, , , , , and . In addition, we can use the fact that to ascertain where is increasing and decreasing, concave up and concave down, and has relative extremes and inflection points. We ultimately find that the graph of is the one given in blue in Figure .  If we want an antiderivative for which , then will have the exact same shape as (since both share the derivative ), but will be shifted vertically from the graph of , as pictured in red in Figure . Note that , just as , but since , , whereas . In the same way, if we assigned a different initial value to the antiderivative, say , we would get still another antiderivative, as shown in magenta in Figure .  This example demonstrates an important fact that holds more generally:   If and are both antiderivatives of a function on an interval , then the function must be constant on the interval .   To see why this result holds, observe that if and are both antiderivatives of , then and . Hence, . Since the only way a function can have derivative zero is by being a constant function, it follows that the function must be constant.  We now see that if a function has at least one antiderivative, it must have infinitely many: we can add any constant of our choice to the antiderivative and get another antiderivative. For this reason, we sometimes refer to the general antiderivative  antiderivative general of a function .  To identify a particular antiderivative of , we must know a single value of the antiderivative (this value is often called an initial condition ). initial condition For example, if , its general antiderivative is , where we include the to indicate that includes all of the possible antiderivatives of . If we know that , we substitute 2 for in , and find that , or . Therefore, the particular antiderivative in this case is .    For each of the following functions, sketch an accurate graph of the antiderivative that satisfies the given initial condition. In addition, sketch the graph of two additional antiderivatives of the given function, and state the corresponding initial conditions that each of them satisfy. If possible, find an algebraic formula for the antiderivative that satisfies the initial condition.   original function: ; initial condition: ; interval for sketch:     original function: ; initial condition: ; interval for sketch:     original function: ; initial condition: ; interval for sketch:                 .               A possible antiderivative that satifies is shown in the figure below, with a possible formula being for and for . Other antiderivatives that satisfy and are also shown.       Thinking both graphically and algebraically reveals that the antiderivative we seek is . Any vertical shift of this function will have the same derivative, but will have a different -intercept.    A possible antiderivative that satifies is shown in the figure below.            Functions defined by integrals  Equation allows us to compute the value of the antiderivative at a point , provided that we know and can evaluate the definite integral from to of . That is, .  In several situations, we have used this formula to compute for several different values of , and then plotted the points to help us draw an accurate graph of . This suggests that we may want to think of , the upper limit of integration, as a variable itself. To that end, we introduce the idea of an integral function , integral function a function whose formula involves a definite integral.    If is a continuous function, we define the corresponding integral function  according to the rule .    Note that because is the independent variable in the function , and determines the endpoint of the interval of integration, we need to use a different variable as the variable of integration. A standard choice is , but any variable other than is acceptable.  One way to think of the function is as the net signed area from up to function, where we consider the region bounded by . For example, in Figure , we see a function pictured at left, and its corresponding area function (choosing ), shown at right.   At left, the graph of the given function . At right, the area function .    The function measures the net signed area from to bounded by the curve ; this value is then reported as the corresponding height on the graph of . This applet , brings the static picture in Figure to life. There, the user can move the red point on the function and see how the corresponding height changes at the light blue point on the graph of .  The choice of is somewhat arbitrary. In the activity that follows, we explore how the value of affects the graph of the integral function.    Suppose that is given by the graph at left in Figure and that is the corresponding integral function defined by .   At left, the graph of ; at right, axes for plotting , where is defined by the formula .       On what interval(s) is an increasing function? On what intervals is decreasing? Why?    On what interval(s) do you think is concave up? concave down? Why?    At what point(s) does have a relative minimum? a relative maximum?    Use the given information to determine the exact values of , , , , , , and .    Based on your responses to all of the preceding questions, sketch a complete and accurate graph of on the axes provided, being sure to indicate the behavior of for and .    How does the graph of compare to if is instead defined by ?          Where is accumulating positive signed area?    As accumulates positive or negative signed area, where is the rate at which such area is accumulated increasing?    Where does change from accumulating positive signed area to accumulating negative signed area?    Note, for instance, that .    Use your work in (a)-(d) appropriately.    What is the value of ? How does this compare to ?           is increasing on , ; is decreasing on .     is concave up on and ; is concave down on and .    At , has a relative maximum; has a relative minimum at .     ; ; ; ; , , .    Use your work in (a)-(d) appropriately.     .           is accumulating positive signed area wherever is positive, and thus is increasing on , ; is accumulating negative signed area and therefore decreasing wherever is negative, which occurs on .    Here we want to consider where is changing at an increasing rate (concave up) or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down). On and , is increasing, and we can also see that since is increasing, is increasing at an increasing rate. Similarly, on (where is negative so is decreasing), since is increasing it follows that is decreasing at an increasing rate. Thus, is concave up on and . Analogous reasoning shows that is concave down on and .    Based on our work in (a), we see that changes from increasing to decreasing at , and thus has a relative maximum there. Similarly, has a relative minimum at .    Using the fact that is piecewise linear and the definition of , we find that ; ; . Analogous reasoning shows that , , , .    Use your work in (a)-(d) appropriately.    Note that , while . Likewise, , while . Indeed, we can see that for any value of , .         Summary     Given the graph of a function , we can construct the graph of its antiderivative provided that (a) we know a starting value of , say , and (b) we can evaluate the integral exactly for relevant choices of and . For instance, if we wish to know , we can compute . When we combine this information about the function values of together with our understanding of how the behavior of affects the overall shape of , we can develop a completely accurate graph of the antiderivative .    Because the derivative of a constant is zero, if is an antiderivative of , it follows that will also be an antiderivative of . Moreover, any two antiderivatives of a function differ precisely by a constant. Thus, any function with at least one antiderivative in fact has infinitely many, and the graphs of any two antiderivatives will differ only by a vertical translation.    Given a function , the rule defines a new function that measures the net-signed area bounded by on the interval . We call the function the integral function corresponding to .       Definite integral of a piecewise linear function   Use the graph of shown below to find the following integrals.   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  A.    B. If the vertical red shaded area in the graph has area , estimate:   (Your estimate may be written in terms of .)             -axis for the values given in in the integral, we have In this case the area is negative because it lies below the -axis. For the second integral, note that the negative area between and is exactly equal to the positive area between and , so that all that is left is the area of the shaded area. Thus,       A smooth function that starts out at 0   Consider the graph of the function shown below.   (Click on the graph for a larger version)  A. Estimate the integral    B. If is an antiderivative of the same function and , estimate :               -axis is greater than the area above the -axis. We count boxes: The area below the -axis includes approximately 11.5 boxes and each box has area , so The area above the -axis includes approximately 2 boxes, each of area 2, so So we have By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have so,       A piecewise constant function   Assume is given by the graph below. Suppose is continuous and that .   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  Sketch, on a sheet of work paper, an accurate graph of , and use it to find each of    and    Then find the value of the integral:    (Note that you can do this in two different ways!)                  , we are given that . Moving to the left on the interval , we have , and we can find by knowing that the change in over this interval is equal to the area under between and . Thus , so that . Similarly, continuing back to , Moving to the right from , we know that on . So, as before, . Similarly, continuing to , Then, the value of the integral is given by the sum Alternatively, knowing and and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have       Another piecewise linear function   The figure below shows .   (Click on the graph for a larger version.)  If and , find for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and fill these values in the following table.     1  2  3  4  5  6                                            , . For each we determine graphically: for regions where is constant, the integral over that region is just (length)(value of f); for regions that are triangular or trapezoidal, we calculate the area using either of (base)(height) (where the height is given by the value of and may be negative), or (length)(average height). Thus,      and, finally, .       A moving particle has its velocity given by the quadratic function pictured in Figure . In addition, it is given that and , as well as that for the corresponding position function , .     Use the given information to determine , , , and . What do these values mean in the context of the moving particle?    On what interval(s) is increasing? That is, when is the particle moving forward? On what interval(s) is decreasing? That is, when is the particle moving backward?    On what interval(s) is concave up? That is, when is the particle accelerating? On what interval(s) is concave down? That is, when is the particle decelerating?    Sketch an accurate, labeled graph of on the axes at right in Figure .    Note that . Find a formula for .      At left, the given graph of . At right, axes for plotting .         , , , .     is increasing on and ; decreasing for .     is concave down for ; concave up for .          .

Similarly, is decreasing for .    The position function is concave down for since is decreasing on this interval, and is concave up for because increases there.    In the following figure, we see a plot of that reflects all of the known information, including the points , , , and .       The general antiderivative of is . Given that , we know that , and thus . Hence, .       A person exercising on a treadmill experiences different levels of resistance and thus burns calories at different rates, depending on the treadmill's setting. In a particular workout, the rate at which a person is burning calories is given by the piecewise constant function pictured in Figure . Note that the units on are calories per minute.

An antiderivative function measures the total number of calories burned in the workout since . Since the units on are ``calories per minute'', the units on are ``calories''.    The value of . Since is piecewise constant, the value of the integral is simply the area of the rectangle bounded by , so . Reasoning similarly,                               In the figure below, we see that is a piecewise linear function that passes through the points we established in (b) (such as and ) and that the slope of on each interval where is constant is simply the value of on that interval (such as on ).        is linear on with slope and passes through the point .

Also, and .                                                          , , and are vertical translations of each other.     .         We use the First Fundamental Theorem and areas under the curves to complete the desired table. As an example, first note that . Then, since the net-signed area between the graph of and the -axis on the interval is the area of a square with side lengths of , we have and thus , so and . . We can also say that and . This allows us to complete the following table.                                                    The graphs are shown the figure below. Note that , , and are all differentiable functions (that are antiderivatives of , so each of their derivatives is ), so the graphs of these functions should be (and are) smooth.

  "body": " The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus     How does the integral function define an antiderivative of ?    What is the statement of the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?    How do the First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Calculus enable us to formally see how differentiation and integration are almost inverse processes?      In Section , we learned the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC), which from here forward will be referred to as the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus First as in this section we develop a corresponding result that follows it. Recall that the First FTC tells us that if is a continuous function on and is any antiderivative of (that is, ), then .  We have used this result in two settings:   If we have a graph of and we can compute the exact area bounded by on an interval , we can compute the change in an antiderivative over the interval.    If we can find an algebraic formula for an antiderivative of , we can evaluate the integral to find the net signed area bounded by the function on the interval.   For the former, see Preview Activity or Activity . For the latter, we can easily evaluate exactly integrals such as , since we know that the function is an antiderivative of . Thus, .  Thus, the First FTC can be used in two ways. First, to find the difference for an antiderivative of the integrand , even if we may not have a formula for itself. To do this, we must know the value of the integral exactly, perhaps through known geometric formulas for area. In addition, the First FTC provides a way to find the exact value of a definite integral, and hence a certain net signed area exactly, by finding an antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating its total change over the interval. In this case, we need to know a formula for the antiderivative . Both of these perspectives are reflected in Figure .   At left, the graph of on the interval and the area it bounds. At right, the antiderivative function , whose total change on is the value of the definite integral at left.    The value of a definite integral may have additional meaning depending on context: as the change in position when the integrand is a velocity function, the total amount of pollutant leaked from a tank when the integrand is the rate at which pollution is leaking, or other total changes if the integrand is a rate function. Also, the value of the definite integral is connected to the average value of a continuous function on a given interval: .  In the last part of Section , we studied integral functions of the form . Figure is a particularly important image to keep in mind as we work with integral functions, and the corresponding applet can help us understand the function . In what follows, we use the First FTC to gain additional understanding of the function , where the integrand is given (either through a graph or a formula), and is a constant.   Consider the function defined by the rule , where .   Compute and exactly.    Use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find a formula for that does not involve integrals. That is, use the first FTC to evaluate .    Observe that is a linear function; what kind of function is ?    Using the formula you found in (b) that does not involve integrals, compute .    While we have defined by the rule , it is equivalent to say that is given by the rule . What do you observe about the relationship between and ?        The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Second  The result of Preview Activity is not particular to the function , nor to the choice of as the lower bound in the integral that defines the function . For instance, if we let and set , we can determine a formula for by the First FTC. Specifically, .  Differentiating , since is constant, it follows that , and thus we see that , so is an antiderivative of . And since , is the only antiderivative of for which .  In general, if is any continuous function, and we define the function by the rule , where is an arbitrary constant, then we can show that is an antiderivative of . To see why, let's demonstrate that by using the limit definition of the derivative. Doing so, we observe that , where Equation follows from the fact that . Now, observe that for small values of , , by a simple left-hand approximation of the integral. Thus, as we take the limit in Equation , it follows that .  Hence, is indeed an antiderivative of . In addition, . The preceding argument demonstrates the truth of the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which we state as follows.   The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   second fundamental theorem of calculus If is a continuous function and is any constant, then has a unique antiderivative that satisfies , and that antiderivative is given by the rule .     Suppose that is the function given in Figure and that is a piecewise function whose parts are either portions of lines or portions of circles, as pictured.   At left, the graph of .

Justify your results with at least one sentence of explanation.          If you don't recall it, review the statement of the Second FTC above.    Note that .    Don't miss our key conclusion from (a).    Compare the values of and .

Our earlier work with showed that is an antiderivative of that satisfied . Since and are both antiderivatives of , they differ by a constant, and that constant is .    The Second FTC tells us that and . Thus, and are each antiderivatives of , have the same shape as and , and each differ from by just a constant. Observing that and enables us to easily sketch these shifted versions of .         Understanding Integral Functions  The Second FTC provides us with a way to construct an antiderivative of any continuous function. In particular, if we are given a continuous function and wish to find an antiderivative , we can now say that provides the rule for such an antiderivative, and moreover that . Note especially that we know that , or .  This result is useful for understanding the graph of .    Investigate the behavior of the integral function .     is closely related to the well known error function  error function The error function is defined by the rule and has the key property that for all and moreover that . in probability and statistics. It turns out that the function does not have an elementary antiderivative.  While we cannot evaluate exactly for any value other than , we still can gain a tremendous amount of information about the function . By applying the rule in Equation to , it follows that , so we know a formula for the derivative of , and we know that . This information is precisely the type we were given in Activity , where we were given information about the derivative of a function, but lacked a formula for the function itself.  Using the first and second derivatives of , along with the fact that , we can determine more information about the behavior of . First, we note that for all real numbers , , and thus for all . Thus is an always increasing function. Further, as , , so the slope of the function tends to zero as (and similarly as ). Indeed, it turns out that has horizontal asymptotes as increases or decreases without bound.  In addition, we can observe that , and that , while for and for . This information tells us that is concave up for and concave down for with a point of inflection at .  The only thing we lack at this point is a sense of how big can get as increases. If we use a midpoint Riemann sum with 10 subintervals to estimate , we see that ; a similar calculation to estimate shows little change ( ), so it appears that as increases without bound, approaches a value just larger than , which aligns with the fact that has horizontal asymptotes. Putting all of this information together (and using the symmetry of ), we see the results shown in Figure .   At left, the graph of . At right, the integral function , which is the unique antiderivative of that satisfies .    Because is the antiderivative of that satisfies , values on the graph of represent the net signed area of the region bounded by from 0 up to . We see that the value of increases rapidly near zero but then levels off as increases, since there is less and less additional accumulated area bounded by as increases.      Suppose that and .     On the axes at left in Figure , plot a graph of on the interval . Clearly label the vertical axes with appropriate scale.    What is the key relationship between and , according to the Second FTC?    Use the first derivative test to determine the intervals on which is increasing and decreasing.    Use the second derivative test to determine the intervals on which is concave up and concave down. Note that can be simplified to be written in the form .    Using technology appropriately, estimate the values of and through appropriate Riemann sums.    Sketch an accurate graph of on the righthand axes provided, and clearly label the vertical axes with appropriate scale.      Axes for plotting and .         Use computing technology appropriately to generate the desired graph.    Again, recall the statement of the Second FTC.    Where is positive? negative?    Note that .    Remember that .

It is straightforward to show that is positive for and negative otherwise, thus is CCU on and CCD for and .     , using a midpoint Riemann sum with 10 subintervals. Similarly, .    Recalling that and using the values and information we've found in (b)-(e), we arrive at the graph at below right.            Differentiating an Integral Function  We have seen that the Second FTC enables us to construct an antiderivative for any continuous function as the integral function . If we have a function of the form , then we know that . This shows that integral functions, while perhaps having the most complicated formulas of any functions we have encountered, are nonetheless particularly simple to differentiate. For instance, if , then by the Second FTC, we know immediately that .  In general, we know by the Second FTC that .  This equation says that the derivative of the integral function whose integrand is , is . We see that if we first integrate the function from to , and then differentiate with respect to , these two processes undo each other.  What happens if we differentiate a function and then integrate the result from to ? That is, what can we say about the quantity   We note that is an antiderivative of and apply the First FTC. We see that .  Thus, we see that if we first differentiate and then integrate the result from to , we return to the function , minus the constant value . So the two processes almost undo each other, up to the constant .  The observations made in the preceding two paragraphs demonstrate that differentiating and integrating (where we integrate from a constant up to a variable) are almost inverse processes. This should not be surprising: integrating involves antidifferentiating, which reverses the process of differentiating. On the other hand, we see that there is some subtlety involved, because integrating the derivative of a function does not quite produce the function itself. This is because every function has an entire family of antiderivatives, and any two of those antiderivatives differ only by a constant.

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is the formal, more general statement of the preceding fact: if is a continuous function and is any constant, then is the unique antiderivative of that satisfies .

Thus, from the given graph of , it follows that is increasing wherever is positive (on the intervals , , and ) and decreasing wherever is negative (on and ). Furthermore, is concave up wherever is increasing (on approximately and ) and concave down werever is decreasing (on approximately and ).  In addition, from the given data about definite integrals and properties of the definite integral, we can determine the following function values:   In the figure below, we put all of this information to work and sketch an approximate graph of .       The tide removes sand from the beach at a small ocean park at a rate modeled by the function   A pumping station adds sand to the beach at rate modeled by the function   Both and are measured in cubic yards of sand per hour, is measured in hours, and the valid times are . At time , the beach holds 2500 cubic yards of sand.   What definite integral measures how much sand the tide will remove during the time period ? Why?    Write an expression for , the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach at time . Carefully explain your thinking and reasoning.    At what instantaneous rate is the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach at time changing?    Over the time interval , at approximately what time is the amount of sand on the beach least? What is the corresponding approximate minimum value? Explain and justify your answers fully.         The total sand removed on this time interval is .    The total amount of sand on the beach at time is given by .     cubic yards per hour.     has an absolute minimum on of .         Since the tide removes sand at a rate of cubic yards of sand per hour, on the time interval , it follows that since the units on are ``cubic yards'', the total sand removed on this time interval is .    Because sand is being both removed and added, we can determine the total amount of sand on the beach at a given time by integrating the difference between the the rates at which sand is being added and removed. In particular, since the total change is the integral of the rate of change, we have that the total amount of sand on the beach at time is given by .    We know that measures the total amount of sand on the beach at time . Thus, the instantaneous rate at which the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach is changing at time is given by . We first compute . By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have , and thus cubic yards per hour.    To find where the total sand function has its minimum value on , we look at the behavior of . Plotting on the interval, we see that at , and for , , and for , . Thus, changes from decreasing to increasing at and has an absolute minimum there on the interval . Furthermore, .       When an aircraft attempts to climb as rapidly as possible, its climb rate (in feet per minute) decreases as altitude increases, because the air is less dense at higher altitudes. Given below is a table showing performance data for a certain single engine aircraft, giving its climb rate at various altitudes, where denotes the climb rate of the airplane at an altitude .   Data for the climbing aircraft.    (feet)               (ft\/min)                Let a new function , that also depends on , (say ) measure the number of minutes required for a plane at altitude to climb the next foot of altitude.   Determine a similar table of values for and explain how it is related to the table above. Be sure to discuss the units on .    Give a careful interpretation of a function whose derivative is . Describe what the input is and what the output is. Also, explain in plain English what the function tells us.    Determine a definite integral whose value tells us exactly the number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to 10,000 feet of altitude. Clearly explain why the value of this integral has the required meaning.    Determine a formula for a function whose value tells us the exact number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude.    Estimate the values of and as accurately as you can. Include units on your results.          .

The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral .    The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral .    Estimating the desired integral using subintervals and midpoints, .  Using subintervals and midpoints, .         Since the given climb rate, , is in feet per minute, and the new function, , is measured in minutes per foot, it follows that is the reciprocal of , so . Hence we get the following updated table.     (feet)               (ft\/min)               (min\/ft)                  Given an original function, we know that the units on its derivative are ``units of input per unit of output.'' Since the units on are ``minutes per foot'', it follows that the antiderivative of should have output units of ``minutes'' since its input units are ``feet''. The antiderivative function should thus tell us the total number of minutes that it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of feet.    The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral since the units on are ``minutes per foot'' and the units on in the corresponding Riemann sum are ``feet'', so when we take the product of quantities with these units, the resulting numerical quantity is measured in minutes.    Reasoning similarly to our work in (c), the number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to feet of altitude is given by the definite integral . Note that because is the upper limit of integration, we need to use a different variable ( ) of integration.    The best possible estimates are provided by using the midpoint rule (we will learn why in Chapter 6, but the can also be determined by using left and right rules and thinking about the error for an always decreasing function like ).  On the interval , if we evaluate the function at every other data point, we can estimate the desired integral using subintervals and find that . Thus, it takes the plane a bit less than minutes to climb to an altitude of 6,000 feet.  Using subintervals, . Thus, it takes the plane a bit more than minutes to climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet.  Note that in both of these computations, we are using to denote the midpoint rule with subintervals, and this `` '' is different from the one we used earlier in .       "

What is an indefinite integral and how is its notation used in discussing antiderivatives?    How does the technique of -substitution work to help us evaluate certain indefinite integrals, and how does this process rely on identifying function-derivative pairs?      In Section , we learned the key role that antiderivatives play in the process of evaluating definite integrals exactly. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that if is any antiderivative of , then .  Furthermore, we realized that each elementary derivative rule developed in Chapter leads to a corresponding elementary antiderivative, as summarized in Table . Thus, if we wish to evaluate an integral such as , it is straightforward to do so, since we can easily antidifferentiate . Because one antiderivative of is , the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that .  We see that we have a natural interest in being able to find such algebraic antiderivatives. We emphasize algebraic antiderivatives, as opposed to any antiderivative, since we know by the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that is indeed an antiderivative of the given function , but one that still involves a definite integral. Our goal in this section is to undo the process of differentiation to find an algebraic antiderivative for a given function.   In Section , we learned the Chain Rule and how it can be applied to find the derivative of a composite function. In particular, if is a differentiable function of , and is a differentiable function of , then .  In words, we say that the derivative of a composite function , where is considered the outer function and the inner function, is the derivative of the outer function, evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function.      For each of the following functions, use the Chain Rule to find the function's derivative. Be sure to label each derivative by name (e.g., the derivative of should be labeled ).                                 For each of the following functions, use your work in (a) to help you determine the general antiderivative Recall that the general antiderivative of a function includes to reflect the entire family of functions that share the same derivative. of the function. Label each antiderivative by name (e.g., the antiderivative of should be called ). In addition, check your work by computing the derivative of each proposed antiderivative.                               Based on your experience in parts (a) and (b), conjecture an antiderivative for each of the following functions. Test your conjectures by computing the derivative of each proposed antiderivative.                         Reversing the Chain Rule: First Steps  Whenever is a familiar function whose antiderivative is known and is a linear function, it is straightforward to antidifferentiate a function of the form .    Determine the general antiderivative of . Check the result by differentiating.  For this composite function, the outer function is , while the inner function is . Since the antiderivative of is , we see that the antiderivative of is .  The inclusion of the constant is essential precisely because the derivative of the inner function is . Indeed, if we now compute , we find by the Chain Rule (and Constant Multiple Rule) that , and thus is indeed the general antiderivative of .    Hence, in the special case where the outer function is familiar and the inner function is linear, we can antidifferentiate composite functions according to the following rule.   If and is a known algebraic antiderivative of , then the general antiderivative of is given by .   It is useful to have shorthand notation that indicates the instruction to find an antiderivative. Thus, in a similar way to how the notation represents the derivative of with respect to , we use the notation of the indefinite integral , indefinite integral  to represent the general antiderivative of with respect to . Returning to the earlier example with , we can rephrase the relationship between and its antiderivative through the notation .  When we find an antiderivative, we will often say that we evaluate an indefinite integral . indefinite integral evaluate Just as the notation means find the derivative with respect to of , the notation means find a function of whose derivative is .     Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals. Check each antiderivative that you find by differentiating.                                       Think .    Think .    Think .    Think .

We know , so .    Observe that , and thus viewing , we see that     Since , we have that .         Reversing the Chain Rule: -substitution  -substitution  A natural question arises from our recent work: what happens when the inner function is not linear? For example, can we find antiderivatives of such functions as   It is important to remember that differentiation and antidifferentiation are almost inverse processes (that they are not is due to the that arises when antidifferentiating). This almost-inverse relationship enables us to take any known derivative rule and rewrite it as a corresponding rule for an indefinite integral. For example, since , we can equivalently write .  Recall that the Chain Rule states that .  Restating this relationship in terms of an indefinite integral, .   Equation tells us that if we can view a given function as for some appropriate choices of and , then we can antidifferentiate the function by reversing the Chain Rule. Note that both and appear in the form of ; we will sometimes say that we seek to identify a function-derivative pair  function-derivative pair ( and ) when trying to apply the rule in Equation .  If we can identify a function-derivative pair, we will introduce a new variable to represent the function . With , it follows in Leibniz notation that , so that in terms of differentials If we recall from the definition of the derivative that and use the fact that , then we see that . Solving for , . It is this last relationship that, when expressed in differential notation enables us to write in the change of variable formula. , . Now converting the indefinite integral to a new one in terms of , we have .  Provided that is an elementary function whose antiderivative is known, we can easily evaluate the indefinite integral in , and then go on to determine the desired overall antiderivative of . We call this process -substitution , and summarize the rule as follows:   With the substitution , .   To see -substitution at work, we consider the following example.    Evaluate the indefinite integral and check the result by differentiating.    We can make two algebraic observations regarding the integrand, . First, is a composite function; as such, we know we'll need a more sophisticated approach to antidifferentiating. Second, is almost the derivative of ; the only issue is a missing constant. Thus, and are nearly a function-derivative pair. Furthermore, we know the antiderivative of . The combination of these observations suggests that we can evaluate the given indefinite integral by reversing the chain rule through -substitution.  Letting represent the inner function of the composite function , we have , and thus . In differential notation, it follows that , and thus . The original indefinite integral may be slightly rewritten as , and so by substituting for and for , it follows that .  Now we may evaluate the easier integral in , and then replace by the expression . Doing so, we find .  To check our work, we observe by the Chain Rule that , which is indeed the original integrand.    The -substitution worked because the function multiplying was . If instead that function was or , the substitution process would not have worked. This is one of the primary challenges of antidifferentiation: slight changes in the integrand make tremendous differences. For instance, we can use -substitution with and to find that .  However, for the similar indefinite integral , the -substitution is no longer possible because the factor of is missing. Hence, part of the lesson of -substitution is just how specialized the process is: it only applies to situations where, up to a missing constant, the integrand is the result of applying the Chain Rule to a different, related function.    Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals by using these steps:   Find two functions within the integrand that form (up to a possible missing constant) a function-derivative pair;    Make a substitution and convert the integral to one involving and ;    Evaluate the new integral in ;    Convert the resulting function of back to a function of by using your earlier substitution;    Check your work by differentiating the function of . You should come up with the integrand originally given.                           Note that and form a function-derivative pair.    Recall that is its own derivative.    Observe that .           .     .     .          Since and form a function-derivative pair, we let , and observe that , and thus . Applying this substitution, integrating, and substituting back, .    Because , if we let , it follows . Substituting and integrating, .    Let , so that . We observe that , and thus .         Evaluating Definite Integrals via -substitution  We have introduced -substitution as a means to evaluate indefinite integrals of functions that can be written, up to a constant multiple, in the form . This same technique can be used to evaluate definite integrals involving such functions, though we need to be careful with the corresponding limits of integration. Consider, for instance, the definite integral .  Whenever we write a definite integral, it is implicit that the limits of integration correspond to the variable of integration. To be more explicit, observe that .  When we execute a -substitution, we change the variable of integration; it is essential to note that this also changes the limits of integration. For instance, with the substitution and , it also follows that when , , and when , . Thus, under the change of variables of -substitution, we now have .  Alternatively, we could consider the related indefinite integral , find the antiderivative through -substitution, and then evaluate the original definite integral. With that method, we'd have , which is, of course, the same result.    Evaluate each of the following definite integrals exactly through an appropriate -substitution.                        Let .     and form a function-derivative pair                .     .     .          Let , so and . Note that implies and implies . Thus, .    First consider the corresponding indefinite integral, , and let so that . We see , and thus . Applying this antiderivative to the definite integral, we see that .    Using the substitution , it follows that . Hence, .         Summary     To find algebraic formulas for antiderivatives of more complicated algebraic functions, we need to think carefully about how we can reverse known differentiation rules. To that end, it is essential that we understand and recall known derivatives of basic functions, as well as the standard derivative rules.    The indefinite integral provides notation for antiderivatives. When we write , we mean the general antiderivative of . In particular, if we have functions and such that , the following two statements say the exact thing: . That is, is the derivative of , and is an antiderivative of .    The technique of -substitution helps us to evaluate indefinite integrals of the form through the substitutions and , so that . A key part of choosing the expression in to be represented by is the identification of a function-derivative pair. To do so, we often look for an inner function that is part of a composite function, while investigating whether (or a constant multiple of ) is present as a multiplying factor of the integrand.

This change of variable transforms the integral into one we can integrate as follows: . Note that here we used the fact that in order to simplify the result.    We let , so it follows that .

Connecting the equalities we have established in our work, we have shown that .       Consider the indefinite integral .

Letting , we find that and thus .    Using the change of variables in (a), .    Using the fact that and distributing, we can evaluate the integral as follows: .    First, for , we let so that and . From there, our work is very similar to what we did in (b): .  For , despite the fact that the integral looks remarkably similar, the situation is quite different. We observe that with , it follows , so we have a standard function-derivative pair. Noting that , it follows that .  In the situation where we have under a square root and a polynomial outside the square root, the substitution will allow us to convert the integrand into an expression we can integrate by changing the form of the radical from to . From there we are able to distribute and integrate an expression that is essentially a sum of (fractional) powers of . In the situation where a polynomial of degree higher than (such as ) is under the radical, we likely have to be fortunate enough to have the derivative of said polynomial (up to a constant) outside the radical in order to be able to integrate, as we were in the last example.       Consider the indefinite integral .   Explain why the substitution will not work to help evaluate the given integral.    Recall the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity, which states that . By observing that , use the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite the integrand as the product of with another function.

Using this substitution and evaluating the resulting integral, .    Here we observe that , so letting and thus , we have .       For the town of Mathland, MI, residential power consumption has shown certain trends over recent years. Based on data reflecting average usage, engineers at the power company have modeled the town's rate of energy consumption by the function .  Here, measures time in hours after midnight on a typical weekday, and is the rate of consumption in megawatts The unit megawatt is itself a rate, which measures energy consumption per unit time. A megawatt-hour is the total amount of energy that is equivalent to a constant stream of 1 megawatt of power being sustained for 1 hour. at time . Units are critical throughout this problem.   Sketch a carefully labeled graph of on the interval [0,24] and explain its meaning. Why is this a reasonable model of power consumption?    Without calculating its value, explain the meaning of . Include appropriate units on your answer.    Determine the exact amount of energy Mathland consumes in a typical day.    What is Mathland's average rate of power consumption in a given 24-hour period? What are the units on this quantity?         The model is reasonable because it appears to be periodic and the rate of consumption seems to peak at the times of day where people are most active in their homes.       The total energy consumed in hours, measured in megawatt-hours.     megawatt-hours of power used in hours.    megawatt-hours.        In the following plot, we see that the model is reasonable because it appears to be periodic and repeats every hours, as well as that the rate of consumption seems to peak at the times of day where people are most active in their homes: around a.m. and around p.m.       The meaning of is the total power consumed in hours, measured in megawatt-hours. This is because is measured in megawatts and in hours, and thus in the Riemann sum that corresponds to the definite integral, the terms in the sum of the form have units ``megawatt-hours''. Moreover, by integrating the rate of power consumption we get the total change in power consumed.    In a typical day, we know that Mathland consumes megawatt-hours of power, and thus we seek to evaluate the integral . To do so, we use the subtitutions (so ) and (so ) to help us antidifferentiate the two trigonometric expressions, and thus we find that and . Putting this all together and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have megawatt-hours of power used in hours.   We know that the average value of the rate function on is . Thus, by our work in (c), we have that which is measured in megawatts.      "

  "body": " Integration by Parts     How do we evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as and ?    What is the method of integration by parts and how can we consistently apply it to integrate products of basic functions?    How does the algebraic structure of functions guide us in identifying and in using integration by parts?      In Section , we learned the technique of -substitution for evaluating indefinite integrals. For example, the indefinite integral is perfectly suited to -substitution, because one factor is a composite function and the other factor is the derivative (up to a constant) of the inner function. Recognizing the algebraic structure of a function can help us to find its antiderivative.  Next we consider integrands with a different elementary algebraic structure: a product of basic functions. For instance, suppose we are interested in evaluating the indefinite integral .  The integrand is the product of the basic functions and . We know that it is relatively complicated to compute the derivative of the product of two functions, so we should expect that antidifferentiating a product should be similarly involved. Intuitively, we expect that evaluating will involve somehow reversing the Product Rule.  To that end, in Preview Activity we refresh our understanding of the Product Rule and then investigate some indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions.   In Section , we developed the Product Rule and studied how it is employed to differentiate a product of two functions. In particular, recall that if and are differentiable functions of , then .     For each of the following functions, use the Product Rule to find the function's derivative. Be sure to label each derivative by name (e.g., the derivative of should be labeled ).                                 Use your work in (a) to help you evaluate the following indefinite integrals. Use differentiation to check your work.                               Observe that the examples in (b) work nicely because of the derivatives you were asked to calculate in (a). Each integrand in (b) is precisely the result of differentiating one of the products of basic functions found in (a). To see what happens when an integrand is still a product but not necessarily the result of differentiating an elementary product, we consider how to evaluate .   First, observe that . Integrating both sides indefinitely and using the fact that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals, we find that . In this last equation, evaluate the indefinite integral on the left side as well as the rightmost indefinite integral on the right.    In the most recent equation from (i.), solve the equation for the expression .    For which product of basic functions have you now found the antiderivative?           Reversing the Product Rule: Integration by Parts  integration by parts  Problem (c) in Preview Activity provides a clue to the general technique known as Integration by Parts, which comes from reversing the Product Rule. Recall that the Product Rule states that .  Integrating both sides of this equation indefinitely with respect to , we find .  On the left side of Equation , we have the indefinite integral of the derivative of a function. Temporarily omitting the constant that may arise, we have .  We solve for the first indefinite integral on the left to generate the rule .  Often we express Equation in terms of the variables and , where and . In differential notation, and , so we can state the rule for Integration by Parts in its most common form as follows:    .   To apply integration by parts, we look for a product of basic functions that we can identify as and . If we can antidifferentiate to find , and evaluating is not more difficult than evaluating , then this substitution usually proves to be fruitful. To demonstrate, we consider the following example.    Evaluate the indefinite integral using integration by parts.    When we use integration by parts, we have a choice for and . In this problem, we can either let and , or let and . While there is not a universal rule for how to choose and , a good guideline is this: do so in a way that is at least as simple as the original problem .  This leads us to choose Observe that if we considered the alternate choice, and let and , then and , from which we would write . Thus we have replaced the problem of integrating with that of integrating ; the latter is clearly more complicated, which shows that this alternate choice is not as helpful as the first choice.  and , from which it follows that and . With this substitution, the rule for integration by parts tells us that .  All that remains to do is evaluate the (simpler) integral . Doing so, we find . Observe that when we get to the final stage of evaluating the last remaining antiderivative, it is at this step that we include the integration constant, .    The general technique of integration by parts involves trading the problem of integrating the product of two functions for the problem of integrating the product of two related functions. That is, we convert the problem of evaluating to that of evaluating . This clearly shapes our choice of and . In Example , the original integral to evaluate was , and through the substitution provided by integration by parts, we were instead able to evaluate . Note that the original function was replaced by its derivative, while was replaced by its antiderivative.    Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals. Check each antiderivative that you find by differentiating.                             Try .    Let     Remember that .    Note that has a simple derivative to work with.           .     .     .     .          Using and , we obtain and . So We check using differentiation as follows:     Using and , we obtain and . So We check using differentiation as follows:     Using and , we obtain and . So We check using differentiation as follows:     Using and , we obtain and . So We check using differentiation as follows:          Some Subtleties with Integration by Parts  Sometimes integration by parts is not an obvious choice, but the technique is appropriate nonetheless. Integration by parts allows us to replace one function in a product with its derivative while replacing the other with its antiderivative. For instance, consider evaluating .  Initially, this problem seems ill-suited to integration by parts, since there does not appear to be a product of functions present. But if we note that , and realize that we know the derivative of as well as the antiderivative of , we see the possibility for the substitution and . We explore this substitution further in Activity .  In a related problem, consider . Observe that there is a composite function present in , but there is not an obvious function-derivative pair, as we have (rather than simply ) multiplying . In this problem we use both -substitution and integration by parts. First we write and consider the indefinite integral . We let so that , and thus . (We are using the variable to perform a -substitution first so that we may then apply integration by parts.) Under this -substitution, we now have .  The resulting integral can be evaluated by parts. This, too, is explored further in Activity .  These problems show that we sometimes must think creatively in choosing the variables for substitution in integration by parts, and that we may need to use substitution for an additional change of variables.    Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals, using the provided hints.   Evaluate by using Integration by Parts with the substitution and .    Evaluate . Consider a similar substitution to the one in (a).    Use the substitution to transform the integral to a new integral in the variable , and evaluate that new integral by parts.    Evaluate using an approach similar to that described in (c).    Evaluate . You will find it helpful to note that .           .     .     .     .     .          We use integration by parts with and . So and . For the integral in the last equation, use the substitution and .     Using and , we obtain and . So     Using , we obtain and . So Now using integration by parts with and , we obtain and . So Finally, we use and obtain .    Use a substitution with and . Now use integration by parts with and . So and .     Using , we see that and so In Example , we saw that . Combining these two results, we obtain          Using Integration by Parts Multiple Times  Integration by parts is well suited to integrating the product of basic functions, allowing us to trade a given integrand for a new one where one function in the product is replaced by its derivative, and the other is replaced by its antiderivative. The goal in this trade of for is that the new integral be simpler to evaluate than the original one. Sometimes it is necessary to apply integration by parts more than once in order to evaluate a given integral.    Evaluate .    Let and . Then and , and thus .  The integral on the right side is simpler to evaluate than the one on the left, but it still requires integration by parts. Now letting and , we have and , so that .  (Note the parentheses, which remind us to distribute the minus sign to the entire value of the integral .) The final integral on the right is a basic one; evaluating that integral and distributing the minus sign, we find .    Of course, even more than two applications of integration by parts may be necessary. In the preceding example, if the integrand had been , we would have had to use integration by parts three times.  Next, we consider the slightly different scenario.    Evaluate .    We can choose to let be either or ; we pick , and thus . With and , integration by parts tells us that , or equivalently that .  The new integral has the same algebraic structure as the original one. While the overall situation isn't necessarily better than what we started with, it hasn't gotten worse. Thus, we proceed to integrate by parts again. This time we let and , so that and , which implies .  We seem to be back where we started, as two applications of integration by parts has led us back to the original problem, . But if we look closely at Equation , we see that we can use algebra to solve for the value of the desired integral. Adding to both sides of the equation, we have , and therefore .  Note that since we never actually encountered an integral we could evaluate directly, we didn't have the opportunity to add the integration constant until the final step.      Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals.                        ( Hint: At a certain point in this problem, it is very helpful to note that .)          Start with .    Begin with .    You'll have to integrate by parts twice.    Start with .    Try .           .     .     .     .     .          First, using and , we get and . So . Now, for , we use and and get and . So     Using and , we get and . So     We use and . This gives and , and . For , we use and . So and , and     We use , , , and . This gives . We now use , , , and for .     Using , , , and , we get          Evaluating Definite Integrals Using Integration by Parts  We can use the technique of integration by parts to evaluate a definite integral.    Evaluate .    One option is to find an antiderivative (using indefinite integral notation) and then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find that .  Alternatively, we can apply integration by parts and work with definite integrals throughout. With this method, we must remember to evaluate the product over the given limits of integration. Using the substitution and , so that and , we write .    As with any substitution technique, it is important to use notation carefully and completely, and to ensure that the end result makes sense.    When -substitution and Integration by Parts Fail to Help  Both integration techniques we have discussed apply in relatively limited circumstances. It is not hard to find examples of functions for which neither technique produces an antiderivative; indeed, there are many, many functions that appear elementary but that do not have an elementary algebraic antiderivative. For instance, neither -substitution nor integration by parts proves fruitful for the indefinite integrals . While there are other integration techniques, some of which we will consider briefly, none of them enables us to find an algebraic antiderivative for or . We do know from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that we can construct an integral antiderivative for each function; is an antiderivative of , and is an antiderivative of . But finding an elementary algebraic formula that doesn't involve integrals for either or turns out not only to be impossible through -substitution or integration by parts, but indeed impossible altogether. Antidifferentiation is much harder in general than differentiation.    Summary     Through the method of integration by parts, we can evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as and . Using a substitution enables us to trade one of the functions in the product for its derivative, and the other for its antiderivative, in an effort to find a different product of functions that is easier to integrate.    If the algebraic structure of an integrand is a product of basic functions in the form , we can use the substitution and and apply the rule to evaluate the original integral by instead evaluating .    When deciding to integrate by parts, we have to select both and . That selection is guided by the overall principle that the new integral not be more difficult than the original integral . In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as ), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable . In addition, must be a function that we can antidifferentiate.       Choose which method to use   For each of the following integrals, indicate whether integration by substitution or integration by parts is more appropriate, or if neither method is appropriate. Do not evaluate the integrals.  1.     integration by parts    substitution    neither    2.     substitution    neither    integration by parts    3.     neither    integration by parts    substitution    4.     integration by parts    neither    substitution    5.     integration by parts    neither    substitution    (Note that because this is multiple choice, you will not be able to see which parts of the problem you got correct.)   to be the argument of a function, etc., such that its derivative, , appears in the integrand; or, if the function looks like one on which integration by parts is good.

Noting that , use the substitution to determine a new, equivalent integral in the variable .    Evaluate the integral you found in (a) using an appropriate technique.    How is the problem of evaluating different from evaluating the integral in (a)? Do so.    Evaluate each of the following integrals as well, keeping in mind the approach(es) used earlier in this problem:                           .     .             .     .     .            We first write . Letting , we have , and thus .    We can evaluate the integral using integration by parts in the standard way with and . Doing so, . Returning to the original integral in and using the substitution we first used with , we have shown that .    For the integral , we actually have a function-derivative pair (up to a constant multiple) already present: letting , , and thus we can evaluate the integral using this substitution. In particular,        For the first integral, , since is the inside function in the composition, we let , so , and write . Hence, . Using the standard integration by parts with and , we find . Re-substituting from back to , we've found that .    The integral can be evaluated using a -substitution since is present to form a function-derivative pair with . It follows that .    For the final integral, , we first observe by the chain rule that , which shows that we have a function-derivative pair present. Using the substitution , it follows , and therefore . The new integral in can be evaluated using several different approaches, including -substitution with , . Doing so, . Returning to the original integral in and our earlier work, substituting backward we find that .          For each of the following indefinite integrals, determine whether you would use -substitution, integration by parts, neither*, or both to evaluate the integral. In each case, write one sentence to explain your reasoning, and include a statement of any substitutions used. (That is, if you decide in a problem to let , you should state that, as well as that .) Finally, use your chosen approach to evaluate each integral. (* one of the following problems does not have an elementary antiderivative and you are not expected to actually evaluate this integral; this will correspond with a choice of neither among those given.)            (Hint: )                              -substitution; .    Both are needed; .    Integration by parts; .    Neither.     -substitution; .    Both are needed; .

When we make this substitution we will have and the integral can be evaluated as follows: .    We might try substituting , since there is a composite function in the integrand. In this case we have . To make this substitution we need to rewrite the integrand as and notice that . Then . We can then try integration by parts on this last integral with We then have .    Since the logarithm function changes to a rational function when we differentiate it, using integration by parts with will make the resulting integral easier to evaluate. So we let and then integration by parts yields .    We might try a substitution with , but then and there is no factor of in the integrand to allow us to complete this substitution. If we attempt to integrate by parts, then only option is to let which makes and we only make the integral more complicated. This is one integral we cannot evaluate with the tools we have.    We will try a -substitution with , because the integrand involves a composite function with as the innermost function and because involves the factor which is also present in the integrand. When we make this substitution we have and the integral can be evaluated as follows: .    We will use integration by parts. Notice that and we have a factor we can differentiate ( ) and one we can integrate ( ) (as we did in part (e)). So we let Integration by parts formula now gives .

  "body": " Other Options for Finding Algebraic Antiderivatives     How does the method of partial fractions enable any rational function to be antidifferentiated?    What role have integral tables historically played in the study of calculus and how can a table be used to evaluate integrals such as ?    What role can a computer algebra system play in the process of finding antiderivatives?      We have learned two antidifferentiation techniques: -substitution and integration by parts. The former is used to reverse the chain rule, while the latter to reverse the product rule. But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances. For example, while may be evaluated by -substitution and by integration by parts, neither method provides a route to evaluate , and in fact an elementary algebraic antiderivative for does not exist. No antidifferentiation method will provide us with a simple algebraic formula for a function that satisfies .  In this section of the text, our main goals are to identify some classes of functions that can be antidifferentiated, and to learn some methods to do so. We should also recognize that there are many functions for which an algebraic formula for an antiderivative does not exist, and appreciate the role that computing technology can play in finding antiderivatives of other complicated functions.   For each of the indefinite integrals below, the main question is to decide whether the integral can be evaluated using -substitution, integration by parts, a combination of the two, or neither. For integrals for which your answer is affirmative, state the substitution(s) you would use. It is not necessary to actually evaluate any of the integrals completely, unless the integral can be evaluated immediately using a familiar basic antiderivative.    , ,  ,       ,  ,  , ,     ,  ,  , ,     ,  ,  , ,        The Method of Partial Fractions  partial fractions  The method of partial fractions is used to integrate rational functions. It involves reversing the process of finding a common denominator.    Evaluate .    If we factor the denominator, we can see how might be the sum of two fractions of the form , so we suppose that and look for the constants and .  Multiplying both sides of this equation by , we find that .  Since we want this equation to hold for every value of , we can use insightful choices of specific -values to help us find and . Taking , we have , so . Choosing , it follows , so . Thus, .  This integral is straightforward to evaluate, and hence we find that .    It turns out that we can use the method of partial fractions, together with -substitution and other algebraic techniques, Specifically, if we encounter a quadratic function of the form that we cannot factor, we complete the square to rewrite it as . Then the substitution enables us to antidifferentiate the result. to rewrite any rational function where the degree of the polynomial is less than If the degree of is greater than or equal to the degree of , long division may be used to write as the sum of a polynomial plus a rational function where the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's. the degree of as a sum of simpler rational functions of one of the following forms: where , , and are real numbers, and is a positive real number. Because we can antidifferentiate each of these basic forms, partial fractions enables us to antidifferentiate any rational function.  A computer algebra system such as Maple , Mathematica , or WolframAlpha can be used to find the partial fraction decomposition of any rational function. In WolframAlpha , entering    partial fraction 5x\/(x^2-x-2)    results in the output .  We will use technology to generate partial fraction decompositions of rational functions, and then evaluate the integrals using established methods.    For each of the following problems, evaluate the integral by using the partial fraction decomposition provided.    , given that      , given that      , given that            .     .     ,           .     .     .           .     .    By the partial fractions decomposition, . Observing that , it now follows that . Noting that can be evaluated by the -substitution , we see that . Thus .         Using an Integral Table  Calculus has a long history, going back to Greek mathematicians in 400-300 BC. Its main foundations were first investigated and understood independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 1600s, making the modern ideas of calculus well over 300 years old. It is instructive to realize that until the late 1980s, the personal computer did not exist, so calculus (and other mathematics) had to be done by hand for roughly 300 years. In the 21st century, however, computers have revolutionized many aspects of the world we live in, including mathematics. In this section we take a short historical tour to precede discussing the role computer algebra systems can play in evaluating indefinite integrals. In particular, we consider a class of integrals involving certain radical expressions.  As seen in the short table of integrals found in Appendix , there are many forms of integrals that involve and . These integral rules can be developed using a technique known as trigonometric substitution that we choose to omit; instead, we will simply accept the results presented in the table. To see how these rules are used, consider the differences among .  The first integral is a familiar basic one, and results in . The second integral can be evaluated using a standard -substitution with . The third, however, is not familiar and does not lend itself to -substitution.  In Appendix , we find the rule .  Using the substitutions and (so that ), it follows that .  Whenever we are applying a rule in the table, we are doing a -substitution, especially when the substitution is more complicated than setting as in the last example.    Evaluate the integral .    Here, we want to use Rule (c) from the table, but we now set and . We also choose the option in the rule. With this substitution, it follows that , so . Applying the substitution, .  By Rule (c), we now find that .    Whenever we use a -subsitution in conjunction with Appendix , it's important that we not forget to address any constants that arise and include them in our computations, such as the that appeared in Example .    For each of the following integrals, evaluate the integral using -substitution and\/or an entry from the table found in Appendix .                             Compare .    Try a straightforward -substitution; the table is unneeded.    Let and and look for a similar integral in the table.    Let and ; find a related integral in the table.           .     .     .     .          By (c) in Appendix with and , .    Let , so . Thus .    Letting and , we see . Thus, . Now by (b) in Appendix , it follows .    Letting and , it follows and , and therefore . Using (k) in Appendix and the fact that , we see .         Using Computer Algebra Systems  A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that is capable of executing symbolic mathematics. For example, if we ask a CAS to solve the equation for the variable , where , , and are arbitrary constants, the program will return . Research to develop the first CAS dates to the 1960s, and these programs became publicly available in the early 1990s. Two prominent examples are the programs Maple and Mathematica , which were among the first computer algebra systems to offer a graphical user interface. Today, Maple and Mathematica are exceptionally powerful professional software packages that can execute an amazing array of sophisticated mathematical computations. They are also very expensive, as each is a proprietary program. The CAS SAGE is an open-source, free alternative to Maple and Mathematica .  For the purposes of this text, when we need to use a CAS, we are going to turn instead to a similar, but somewhat different computational tool, the web-based computational knowledge engine called WolframAlpha . There are two features of WolframAlpha that make it stand out from the CAS options mentioned above: (1) unlike Maple and Mathematica , WolframAlpha is free (provided we are willing to navigate some pop-up advertising); and (2) unlike any of the three, the syntax in WolframAlpha is flexible. Think of WolframAlpha as being a little bit like doing a Google search: the program will interpret what is input, and then provide a summary of options.  If we want to have WolframAlpha evaluate an integral for us, we can provide it syntax such as    integrate x^2 dx    to which the program responds with .  While there is much to be enthusiastic about regarding CAS programs such as WolframAlpha , there are several things we should be cautious about: (1) a CAS only responds to exactly what is input; (2) a CAS can answer using powerful functions from very advanced mathematics; and (3) there are problems that even a CAS cannot do without additional human insight.  Although (1) likely goes without saying, we have to be careful with our input: if we enter syntax that defines the wrong function, the CAS will work with precisely the function we define. For example, if we are interested in evaluating the integral , and we mistakenly enter    integrate 1\/16 - 5x^2 dx    a CAS will (correctly) reply with .  But if we are sufficiently well-versed in antidifferentiation, we will recognize that this function cannot be the one that we seek: integrating a rational function such as , we expect the logarithm function to be present in the result.  Regarding (2), even for a relatively simple integral such as , some CASs will invoke advanced functions rather than simple ones. For instance, if we use Maple to execute the command    int(1\/(16-5*x^2), x);    the program responds with .  While this is correct (save for the missing arbitrary constant, which Maple never reports), the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is not a common nor familiar one; a simpler way to express this function can be found by using the partial fractions method, and happens to be the result reported by WolframAlpha : .  Using sophisticated functions from more advanced mathematics is sometimes the way a CAS says to the user I don't know how to do this problem. For example, if we want to evaluate , and we ask WolframAlpha to do so, the input    integrate exp(-x^2) dx    results in the output .  The function erf is the error function , error function which is actually defined by an integral: .  So, in producing output involving an integral, the CAS has basically reported back to us the very question we asked.  Finally, as remarked at (3) above, there are times that a CAS will actually fail without some additional human insight. If we consider the integral and ask WolframAlpha to evaluate    int (1+x) * exp(x) * sqrt(1+x^2 * exp(2x)) dx ,   the program thinks for a moment and then reports   ( no result found in terms of standard mathematical functions )   But in fact this integral is not that difficult to evaluate. If we let , then , which means that the preceding integral has form , which is a straightforward one for any CAS to evaluate.  So, we should proceed with some caution: while any CAS is capable of evaluating a wide range of integrals (both definite and indefinite), there are times when the result can mislead us. We must think carefully about the meaning of the output, whether it is consistent with what we expect, and whether or not it makes sense to proceed.    Summary     We can antidifferentiate any rational function with the method of partial fractions. Any polynomial function can be factored into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic terms, so any rational function may be written as the sum of a polynomial plus rational terms of the form (where is a natural number) and (where is a positive real number).    Until the development of compute algebra systems, integral tables enabled students of calculus to evaluate integrals such as , where is a positive real number. A short table of integrals may be found in Appendix .    Computer algebra systems can play an important role in finding antiderivatives, though we must be cautious to use correct input, to watch for unusual or unfamiliar advanced functions that the CAS may cite in its result, and to consider the possibility that a CAS may need further assistance or insight from us in order to answer a particular question.       Partial fractions: linear over difference of squares   Calculate the integral below by partial fractions and by using the indicated substitution. Be sure that you can show how the results you obtain are the same.  First, rewrite this with partial fractions:       +  .  (Note that you should not include the in your entered answer, as it has been provided at the end of the expression.)  Next, use the substitution to find the integral:        .  (For the second answer blank, give your antiderivative in terms of the variable . Again, note that you should not include the in your answer.)                                      so that Solving, we get , so that Using the substitution , we get , so we have The properties of logarithms show that the two results are the same:       Partial fractions: constant over product   Calculate the integral:          giving or Solving for and , we find and , so       Partial fractions: linear over quadratic   Calculate the integral          Multiplying by and , this becomes or Solving this system yields and . Then       Partial fractions: cubic over 4th degree   Consider the following indefinite integral.  The integrand has partial fractions decomposition:  where          Now integrate term by term to evaluate the integral.  Answer:                                 Partial fractions: quadratic over factored cubic   The form of the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function is given below.         Now evaluate the indefinite integral.                         SOLUTION  Multiplying by the least common denominator gives Rearranging terms on the right hand side, yields Now we equate the coefficients: Solving the system gives and so the partial fraction decomposition is The definite integral is then        For each of the following integrals involving rational functions, (1) use a CAS to find the partial fraction decomposition of the integrand; (2) evaluate the integral of the resulting function without the assistance of technology; (3) use a CAS to evaluate the original integral to test and compare your result in (2).                             .     .         WolframAlpha shows that . Then, using standard antiderivatives, Directly asking WolframAlpha to integrate yields . By rearranging, distributing the , and noticing that WolframAlpha does not use absolute value with integrals involving the logarithm (as well as that ), we see that these two results are the same.    WolframAlpha shows that . Then, using standard antiderivatives, . Directly asking WolframAlpha to integrate yields the same result with the caveats mentioned in part (a).    WolframAlpha shows that . Then, using standard antiderivatives, . Directly asking WolframAlpha to integrate yields . The logarithm part is the same, and since , we see that the rest of the result matches as well.       For each of the following integrals involving radical functions, (1) use an appropriate -substitution along with Appendix to evaluate the integral without the assistance of technology, and (2) use a CAS to evaluate the original integral to test and compare your result in (1).                             .               .         For , we let so and . Applying this substitution, . Now, using Rule (e) from the appendix with , Substituting back to , we've shown that . Asking WolframAlpha to evaluate the same original integral, the program reports that . These two results are in fact the same (the program uses where we use ), though it takes some work with logarithm properties to show this. Using the rule and and including the value in the arbitrary constant of integration, it follows that the two results match.    For , we first recognize that , and that with we have a function-derivative pair present with . Applying this substitution, . Next, we use Rule (c) with and to find that Returning to the original variable, , we have WolframAlpha's first response when asked to evaluate this integral is to give a result that involves the hyperbolic sine function ( ); if we scroll down to alternate results , we find one that matches what we've found above.    For , we first observe that . If we use the substitution , the resulting integral is , which can be evaluated by the same approach as in part (b) with Rule (c) from the Appendix, this time with . Thus, Substituting back, As in part (b), we need to scroll down in WolframAlpha's results to find one close to what we have here. The alternate result almost matches, but the program writes where we have This discrepancy can be explained using properties of the logarithm function and the presence of the arbitrary constant. If we write and then recall that , we see that the can be included in the arbitray constant, and the two different results actually match.    To evaluate the integral , we first write to have the integral in the form . Next, letting , it follows , and therefore . By Rule (j) in the appendix, we know that . Connecting the above chain of equalities and substituting back to , we have shown that . When WolframAlpha is asked to evaluate the original integral, its first result involves the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, and the alternate forms are equally complicated. It seems that the technology is unable to evaluate this integral in the most straightforward way.       Consider the indefinite integral given by .   Explain why -substitution does not offer a way to simplify this integral by discussing at least two different options you might try for .    Explain why integration by parts does not seem to be a reasonable way to proceed, either, by considering one option for and .    Is there any line in the integral table in Appendix that is helpful for this integral?    Evaluate the given integral using WolframAlpha . What do you observe?         Try or .    Try and .    No.    It appears that the function does not have an elementary antiderivative.         Looking at the composite functions that are present, there are two possible -substitutions to try. One is , for which and . Because there is no term present in the integral, this substitution will not work.  A second subsitution to attempt is letting , for which . Here, too, the needed product is not present in the integral in order for the subsitution to work.    For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of that is straightforward to differentiate, and that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of and , it appears that the most natural possible option is to let and , since we can antidifferentiate . Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate , and that integral is which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.    Since we can't seem to find a -substitution that simplifies the given integral, and there are no formulas in the Appendix that use nested square roots, it appears that the table doesn't offer any help in evaluating this particular integral.    WolframAlpha returns results that either involve inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions or complex numbers. As such, it appears that the function does not have an elementary antiderivative that we can find.       "

Are there ways to generate accurate estimates without using extremely large values of in Riemann sums?    What is the Trapezoid Rule, and how is it related to left, right, and middle Riemann sums?    How are the errors in the Trapezoid Rule and Midpoint Rule related, and how can they be used to develop an even more accurate rule?      When we first explored finding the net signed area bounded by a curve, we developed the concept of a Riemann sum as a helpful estimation tool and a key step in the definition of the definite integral. Recall that the left, right, and middle Riemann sums of a function on an interval are given by , where , , , and . For the middle sum, we defined .  A Riemann sum is a sum of (possibly signed) areas of rectangles. The value of determines the number of rectangles, and our choice of left endpoints, right endpoints, or midpoints determines the heights of the rectangles. We can see the similarities and differences among these three options in Figure , where we consider the function on the interval , and use 5 rectangles for each of the Riemann sums.   Left, right, and middle Riemann sums for on with 5 subintervals.    While it is a good exercise to compute a few Riemann sums by hand, just to ensure that we understand how they work and how varying the function, the number of subintervals, and the choice of endpoints or midpoints affects the result, using computing technology is the best way to determine , , and . Any computer algebra system will offer this capability; as we saw in Preview Activity , a straightforward option that is freely available online is this applet . Note that we can adjust the formula for , the window of - and -values of interest, the number of subintervals, and the method. (See Preview Activity for any needed reminders on how the applet works.)  In this section we explore several different alternatives for estimating definite integrals. Our main goal is to develop formulas to estimate definite integrals accurately without using a large numbers of rectangles.   As we begin to investigate ways to approximate definite integrals, it will be insightful to compare results to integrals whose exact values we know. To that end, the following sequence of questions centers on .   Use the applet with the function on the window of values from to to compute , the left Riemann sum with three subintervals.    Likewise, use the applet to compute and , the right and middle Riemann sums with three subintervals, respectively.    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to compute the exact value of .    We define the error that results from an approximation of a definite integral to be the approximation's value minus the integral's exact value. What is the error that results from using ? From ? From ?    In what follows in this section, we will learn a new approach to estimating the value of a definite integral known as the Trapezoid Rule. The basic idea is to use trapezoids, rather than rectangles, to estimate the area under a curve. What is the formula for the area of a trapezoid with bases of length and and height ?    Working by hand, estimate the area under on using three subintervals and three corresponding trapezoids. What is the error in this approximation? How does it compare to the errors you calculated in (d)?        The Trapezoid Rule  trapezoid rule  So far, we have used the simplest possible quadrilaterals (that is, rectangles) to estimate areas. It is natural, however, to wonder if other familiar shapes might serve us even better.  An alternative to , , and is called the Trapezoid Rule . Rather than using a rectangle to estimate the (signed) area bounded by on a small interval, we use a trapezoid. For example, in Figure , we estimate the area under the curve using three subintervals and the trapezoids that result from connecting the corresponding points on the curve with straight lines.   Estimating using three subintervals and trapezoids, rather than rectangles, where and .    The biggest difference between the Trapezoid Rule and a Riemann sum is that on each subinterval, the Trapezoid Rule uses two function values, rather than one, to estimate the (signed) area bounded by the curve. For instance, to compute , the area of the trapezoid on , we observe that the left base has length , while the right base has length . The height of the trapezoid is . The area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height, so we have .  Using similar computations for and , we find that , the trapezoidal approximation to is given by .  Because both left and right endpoints are being used, we recognize within the trapezoidal approximation the use of both left and right Riemann sums. Rearranging the expression for by removing factors of and , grouping the left endpoint and right endpoint evaluations of , we see that .  We now observe that two familiar sums have arisen. The left Riemann sum is , and the right Riemann sum is . Substituting and for the corresponding expressions in Equation , it follows that . We have thus seen a very important result: using trapezoids to estimate the (signed) area bounded by a curve is the same as averaging the estimates generated by using left and right endpoints.   The Trapezoid Rule  The trapezoidal approximation, , of the definite integral using subintervals is given by the rule . Moreover, .     In this activity, we explore the relationships among the errors generated by left, right, midpoint, and trapezoid approximations to the definite integral .   Use the First FTC to evaluate exactly.    Use appropriate computing technology to compute the following approximations for : , , , and .    Let the error  error  trapezoid rule error  midpoint rule error that results from an approximation be the approximation's value minus the exact value of the definite integral. For instance, if we let represent the error that results from using the trapezoid rule with 4 subintervals to estimate the integral, we have . Similarly, we compute the error of the midpoint rule approximation with 8 subintervals by the formula . Based on your work in (a) and (b) above, compute , , , .    Which rule consistently over-estimates the exact value of the definite integral? Which rule consistently under-estimates the definite integral?    What behavior(s) of the function lead to your observations in (d)?           .    Use a computational device.    Use a computational device.    Which estimate is larger than the true value of the definite integral?    Note that how the curve bends makes a big difference in whether the trapezoid rule over- or under-estimates the value of the definite integral.           .    The table below gives values of the trapezoid rule and corresponding errors for different -values.                            The table below gives values of the midpoint rule and corresponding errors for different -values.                            The trapezoid rule overestimates; the midpoint rule underestimates.     is concave up on .           .    The table below gives values of the trapezoid rule and corresponding errors for different -values.                            The table below gives values of the midpoint rule and corresponding errors for different -values.                            From the errors in comparision to the known exact value, we see that the trapezoid rule overestimates this definite integral and the midpoint rule underestimates this definite integral.    The graph of the function given by is concave up on the interval . Because of this fact, we can see graphically that the line forming the top of each trapezoid lies fully above the curve, and thus the trapezoid rule overestimates the true value of the definite integral. Later in this section we'll see graphically why this concavity makes the midpoint rule an underestimate.         Comparing the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules  We know from the definition of the definite integral that if we let be large enough, we can make any of the approximations , , and as close as we'd like (in theory) to the exact value of . Thus, it may be natural to wonder why we ever use any rule other than or (with a sufficiently large value) to estimate a definite integral. One of the primary reasons is that as , , and thus in a Riemann sum calculation with a large value, we end up multiplying by a number that is very close to zero. Doing so often generates roundoff error, because representing numbers close to zero accurately is a persistent challenge for computers.  Hence, we explore ways to estimate definite integrals to high levels of precision, but without using extremely large values of . Paying close attention to patterns in errors, such as those observed in Activity , is one way to begin to see some alternate approaches.  To begin, we compare the errors in the Midpoint and Trapezoid rules. First, consider a function that is concave up on a given interval, and picture approximating the area bounded on that interval by both the Midpoint and Trapezoid rules using a single subinterval.   Estimating using a single subinterval: at left, the trapezoid rule; in the middle, the midpoint rule; at right, a modified way to think about the midpoint rule.    As seen in Figure , it is evident that whenever the function is concave up on an interval, the Trapezoid Rule with one subinterval, , will overestimate the exact value of the definite integral on that interval. From a careful analysis of the line that bounds the top of the rectangle for the Midpoint Rule (shown in magenta), we see that if we rotate this line segment until it is tangent to the curve at the midpoint of the interval (as shown at right in Figure ), the resulting trapezoid has the same area as , and this value is less than the exact value of the definite integral. Thus, when the function is concave up on the interval, underestimates the integral's true value.   Comparing the error in estimating using a single subinterval: in red, the error from the Trapezoid rule; in light red, the error from the Midpoint rule.    These observations extend easily to the situation where the function's concavity remains consistent but we use larger values of in the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules. Hence, whenever is concave up on , will overestimate the value of , while will underestimate . The reverse observations are true in the situation where is concave down.  Next, we compare the size of the errors between and . Again, we focus on and on an interval where the concavity of is consistent. In Figure , where the error of the Trapezoid Rule is shaded in red, while the error of the Midpoint Rule is shaded lighter red, it is visually apparent that the error in the Trapezoid Rule is more significant. To see how much more significant, let's consider two examples and some particular computations.  If we let and consider , we know by the First FTC that the exact value of the integral is .  Using appropriate technology to compute , , , and , as well as the corresponding errors , , , and , as we did in Activity , we find the results summarized in Table . We also include the approximations and their errors for the example from Activity .   Calculations of , , , and , along with corresponding errors, for the definite integrals and .    Rule   error   error                                 For a given function and interval , calculates the difference between the approximation generated by the Trapezoid Rule with and the exact value of the definite integral. If we look at not only , but also the other errors generated by using and with and in the two examples noted in Table , we see an evident pattern. Not only is the sign of the error (which measures whether the rule generates an over- or under-estimate) tied to the rule used and the function's concavity, but the magnitude of the errors generated by and seems closely connected. In particular, the errors generated by the Midpoint Rule seem to be about half the size (in absolute value) of those generated by the Trapezoid Rule.  That is, we can observe in both examples that and . This property of the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules turns out to hold in general: for a function of consistent concavity, the error in the Midpoint Rule has the opposite sign and approximately half the magnitude of the error of the Trapezoid Rule. Written symbolically, .  This important relationship suggests a way to combine the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules to create an even more accurate approximation to a definite integral.    Simpson's Rule  Simpson's rule  When we first developed the Trapezoid Rule, we observed that it is an average of the Left and Right Riemann sums: .  If a function is always increasing or always decreasing on the interval , one of and will over-estimate the true value of , while the other will under-estimate the integral. Thus, the errors that result from and will have opposite signs; so averaging and eliminates a considerable amount of the error present in the respective approximations. In a similar way, it makes sense to think about averaging and in order to generate a still more accurate approximation.  We've just observed that is typically about twice as accurate as . So we use the weighted average weighted average  .  The rule for giving by Equation is usually known as Simpson's Rule . Thomas Simpson was an 18th century mathematician; his idea was to extend the Trapezoid rule, but rather than using straight lines to build trapezoids, to use quadratic functions to build regions whose area was bounded by parabolas (whose areas he could find exactly). Simpson's Rule is often developed from the more sophisticated perspective of using interpolation by quadratic functions. Note that we use rather that since the points the Midpoint Rule uses are different from the points the Trapezoid Rule uses, and thus Simpson's Rule is using points at which to evaluate the function. We build upon the results in Table to see the approximations generated by Simpson's Rule. In particular, in Table , we include all of the results in Table , but include additional results for and .   Table updated to include , , and the corresponding errors.    Rule   error   error                                               The results seen in Table are striking. If we consider the approximation of , the error is only . By contrast, , so the error of that estimate is . Moreover, we observe that generating the approximations for Simpson's Rule is almost no additional work: once we have , , and for a given value of , it is a simple exercise to generate , and from there to calculate . Finally, note that the error in the Simpson's Rule approximations of is zero! Similar to how the Midpoint and Trapezoid approximations are exact for linear functions, Simpson's Rule approximations are exact for quadratic and cubic functions. See additional discussion on this issue later in the section and in the exercises.  These rules are not only useful for approximating definite integrals such as , for which we cannot find an elementary antiderivative of , but also for approximating definite integrals when we are given a function through a table of data.    A car traveling along a straight road is braking and its velocity is measured at several different points in time, as given in the following table. Assume that is continuous, always decreasing, and always decreasing at a decreasing rate, as is suggested by the data.

Which of these under-estimates the true distance traveled?    Estimate the total distance traveled on by computing . Is this an over- or under-estimate? Why?    Using your results from (c) and (d), improve your estimate further by using Simpson's Rule.    What is your best estimate of the average velocity of the car on ? Why? What are the units on this quantity?          Plot the data.    What are the units on ?    Recall the standard rules for sums that produce , , .

Since the velocity is always positive, the definite integral that will give the exact distance traveled by the car on the interval is .    The estimates of are . is an underestimate of the distance traveled since is decreasing. is an underestimate of the distance traveled since is concave down.    Another estimate of the distance traveled is . This is an overestimate since is concave down.    For Simpson's Rule, we see that .    Simpson's rule gives the best approximation of the distance traveled since it is a weighted average of the midpoint and trapezoid rules and uses more information about the velocity than the other methods. The units on each of the estimates, including Simpson's Rule, are \"feet\", since ft\/sec sec = ft. Thus, the best approximation we have generated for distance traveled is .  To estimate the average velocity on , we compute change in position divided by change in time. Here, since is always positive, the car's change in position equals its distance traveled. Hence, .         Overall observations regarding , , , , and .  As we conclude our discussion of numerical approximation of definite integrals, it is important to summarize general trends in how the various rules over- or under-estimate the true value of a definite integral, and by how much. To revisit some past observations and see some new ones, we consider the following activity.    Consider the functions , , and , all on the interval .

These results hold because each of the three functions are both decreasing and concave down. For Simpson's rule, we see that the result is exact for both and , while Simpson's rule is a slight underestimate of .       The results seen in Activity generalize nicely. For instance, if is decreasing on , will over-estimate the exact value of , and if is concave down on , will over-estimate the exact value of the integral. An excellent exercise is to write a collection of scenarios of possible function behavior, and then categorize whether each of , , , and is an over- or under-estimate.  Finally, we make two important notes about Simpson's Rule. When T. Simpson first developed this rule, his idea was to replace the function on a given interval with a quadratic function that shared three values with the function . In so doing, he guaranteed that this new approximation rule would be exact for the definite integral of any quadratic polynomial. In one of the pleasant surprises of numerical analysis, it turns out that even though it was designed to be exact for quadratic polynomials, Simpson's Rule is exact for any cubic polynomial: that is, if we are interested in an integral such as , will always be exact, regardless of the value of . This is just one more piece of evidence that shows how effective Simpson's Rule is as an approximation tool for estimating definite integrals. One reason that Simpson's Rule is so effective is that benefits from using points of data. Because it combines , which uses midpoints, and , which uses the endpoints of the chosen subintervals, takes advantage of the maximum amount of information we have when we know function values at the endpoints and midpoints of subintervals.    Summary     For a definite integral such as when we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because the integrand lacks an elementary algebraic antiderivative, we can estimate the integral's value by using a sequence of Riemann sum approximations. Typically, we start by computing , , and for one or more chosen values of .    The Trapezoid Rule, which estimates by using trapezoids, rather than rectangles, can also be viewed as the average of Left and Right Riemann sums. That is, .    The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average , we can build a much more accurate approximation to by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.       Various methods for numerically  In this problem, the notation \"SIMP(2)\" is actually what we have called \"SIMP(4)\" in our previous work. Different authors use different notation, and the author of this WeBWorK exercise chooses to write \"SIMP(n)\" where we have written \"SIMP(2n)\" in Section .

(a)   (b) Computing the sums directly, since , we have LEFT(2) RIGHT(2) TRAP(2) MID(2) and SIMP(2) = (2 MID(2) + TRAP(2))\/3 . And the errors are just the actual value minus the approximate values, or error(LEFT(2)) = 36.8201; error(RIGHT(2)) = -70.3758; error(TRAP(2)) = -16.7782; error(MID(2)) = 7.9906; and error(SIMP(2)) = -0.2656. (c) Similarly, since , we have LEFT(4) = 31.1929; error = 22.4053 RIGHT(4) = 84.7911; error = -31.1928 TRAP(4) = 57.992; error = -4.3937 MID(4) = 51.4284; error = 2.1698 SIMP(4) = 53.6162; error = -0.018. (d) For LEFT and RIGHT, we expect the error to go down by 1\/2, and this is very roughly what we see. For MID and TRAP, we expect the error to go down by 1\/4, and this is approximately what we see. For SIMP, we expect the error to go down by 1\/16, again as observed.        Comparison of methods for increasing concave down function   Using the figure showing below, order the following approximations to the integral and its exact value from smallest to largest.

Here,       Comparing accuracy for two similar functions   Using a fixed number of subdivisions, we approximate the integrals of and on the interval shown in the figure below.   (The function is shown in blue, and in black; click on the graph to get a larger version.)  For which function, or is LEFT more accurate?

Similarly, when the function is bending more rapidly (its slope is changing more rapidly, so that its concavity is greater) MID and TRAP will be less accurate. Therefore both will be more accurate for as well.      Identifying and comparing methods   Consider the four functions shown below. On the first two, an approximation for is shown.    1.   2.     3.   4.     (Click on any graph to get a larger version.)  1.

(Click on any graph to get a larger version.) Then graph 3, showing the midpoint rule, gives an under estimate. Then graph 4, showing the trapezoid rule, gives an under estimate.       Consider the definite integral .   Explain why this integral cannot be evaluated exactly by using either -substitution or by integrating by parts.    Using appropriate subintervals, compute , , , , and .    Which of the approximations in (b) is an over-estimate to the true value of ? Which is an under-estimate? How do you know?          -substitution fails since there's not a composite function present; try showing that each of the choices of and , or and , fail to produce an integral that can be evaluated by parts.                                    and are underestimates; and are overestimates.         We can't use -substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of and , to do so requires us to evaluate the integral , which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead and , then we have to evaluate the integral which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.    We use computational technology to generate the following estimates, which are reported to decimal places of accuracy:                               From the values of these estimates or from the graph of , we can observe that is always increasing and concave up on the interval. Thus, and are underestimates while and are overestimates.       For an unknown function , the following information is known.    is continuous on ;     is either always increasing or always decreasing on ;     has the same concavity throughout the interval ;    As approximations to , , , and .      Is increasing or decreasing on ? What data tells you?    Is concave up or concave down on ? Why?    Determine the best possible estimate you can for , based on the given information.         Decreasing.    Concave down.     .         Because and we know the function is always increasing or always decreasing, for the left endpoint rule to give a value greater than the right endpoint rule, must be always decreasing.    From the given data, we know that . Since , it follows that . In particular, we know that the function is not only always decreasing on the interval, but it also concave down. Because the concavity is constant, it follows that if the trapezoid rule under-estimates the true value, then the midpoint rule must over-estimate the true value (or vice-versa). Since , this means that and that must be concave down on the interval.    We use Simpson's Rule to determine the best possible estimate for the definite integral. That is, .       The rate at which water flows through Table Rock Dam on the White River in Branson, MO, is measured in cubic feet per second (CFS). As engineers open the floodgates, flow rates are recorded according to the following chart.   Water flow data.    seconds,           flow in CFS,               What definite integral measures the total volume of water to flow through the dam in the 60 second time period provided by the table above?    Use the given data to calculate for the largest possible value of to approximate the integral you stated in (a). Do you think over- or under-estimates the exact value of the integral? Why?    Approximate the integral stated in (a) by calculating for the largest possible value of , based on the given data.    Compute and . What quantity do both of these values estimate? Which is a more accurate approximation?          .     .     .     ; . each estimates the average rate at which water flows through the dam on , and the first is more accurate.         Because is measured in cubic feet per second and is measured in seconds, the definite integral measures the total amount of water (in cubic feet) that flow through the dam in 60 seconds.    With function values and thus subintervals as the maximum number of intervals we can use, we can compute since we need to use every other data point to evaluate the function. Doing so, . Thus, approximately cubic feet of water pass through the dam on the interval .  We observe that appears to be increasing at an increasing rate on . In particular, the data suggests that is concave up on the interval. As such, the trapezoid rule will over-estimate the true value of the definite integral and the midpoint rule will under-estimate the value. Thus, .    In order to estimate the integral using , we need to know the value of along with . To find , we compute and . First . Similarly, . Thus, . Finally, we now have the information needed to compute . We thus find that .    First, . This is one estimate for the average value of on since , and . Thus, on average, water is flowing through the dam at a rate of cubic feet per second.  Next, is the average of the known values of on the interval , and thus is one estimate of the average value of . This average treats all of them equally, as opposed to which counts midpoints more than endpoints and is developed in such a way to remove some of the error inherent in using simple estimates like and . This simple average of rate values is analogous to using a left or right Riemann sum, and thus we expect that the estimate of the average value of that comes from is more accurate for computing the average rate at which water flows through the dam.

(c) Similarly, since , we have LEFT(4) = 31.1929; error = 22.4053 RIGHT(4) = 84.7911; error = -31.1928 TRAP(4) = 57.992; error = -4.3937 MID(4) = 51.4284; error = 2.1698 SIMP(4) = 53.6162; error = -0.018. (d) For LEFT and RIGHT, we expect the error to go down by 1\/2, and this is very roughly what we see. For MID and TRAP, we expect the error to go down by 1\/4, and this is approximately what we see. For SIMP, we expect the error to go down by 1\/16, again as observed.     "

  "body": " Using Definite Integrals to Find Area and Length     How can we use definite integrals to measure the area between two curves?    How do we decide whether to integrate with respect to or with respect to when we try to find the area of a region?    How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve?      Early on in our work with the definite integral, we learned that for an object moving along an axis, the area under a non-negative velocity function between and tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval, and that area is given precisely by the definite integral . In general, for any nonnegative function on an interval , measures the area bounded by the curve and the -axis between and .  Next, we will explore how definite integrals can be used to represent other physically important properties. In Preview Activity , we investigate how a single definite integral may be used to represent the area between two curves.   Consider the functions given by and .   Use algebra to find the points where the graphs of and intersect.    Sketch an accurate graph of and on the axes provided, labeling the curves by name and the intersection points with ordered pairs.    Find and evaluate exactly an integral expression that represents the area between and the -axis on the interval between the intersection points of and .    Find and evaluate exactly an integral expression that represents the area between and the -axis on the interval between the intersection points of and .    What is the exact area between and between their intersection points? Why?      Axes for plotting and in Preview Activity       The Area Between Two Curves  area  In Preview Activity , we saw a natural way to think about the area between two curves: it is the area beneath the upper curve minus the area below the lower curve.    Find the area bounded between the graphs of and .   The areas bounded by the functions and on the interval .      In Figure , we see that the graphs intersect at and . We can find these intersection points algebraically by solving the system of equations given by and : substituting for in the second equation yields , so , and thus , from which it follows that or . Using , we find the corresponding -values of the intersection points.  On the interval , the area beneath is , while the area under on the same interval is .  Thus, the area between the curves is .    We can also think of the area this way: if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles (in the same spirit as we originally sliced the region between a single curve and the -axis in Section ), we see (as shown in Figure ) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions, , and its width is . Thus the area of the rectangle is .   The area bounded by the functions and on the interval .    The area between the two curves on is thus approximated by the Riemann sum , and as we let , it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral .  In many applications of the definite integral, we will find it helpful to think of a representative slice and use the definite integral to add these slices. Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.  Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves (as in ) or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves (as in ). These two results are the same, since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference: .  Our work so far in this section illustrates the following general principle.   If two curves and intersect at and , and for all such that , , then the area between the curves is .     In each of the following problems, our goal is to determine the area of the region described. For each region, (i) determine the intersection points of the curves, (ii) sketch the region whose area is being found, (iii) draw and label a representative slice, and (iv) state the area of the representative slice. Then, state a definite integral whose value is the exact area of the region, and evaluate the integral to find the numeric value of the region's area.   The finite region bounded by and .    The finite region bounded by and .    The area bounded by the -axis, , and , where we consider the region formed by the first positive value of for which and intersect.    The finite regions between the curves and .          Find where the two curves intersect.    Plot both functions and think about how they compare to .    Remember that .    Find three points where the curves intersect and thus two finite regions between two pairs of those points.           .     .     .    The left-hand region has area . The right-hand region has area .          By solving , we see that the two curves intersect when and , so at the points and . We can plot the region as shown in the figure below.     Slicing the region with thin vertical rectangles, we see that a typical rectangle's height is given by , and thus the area of such a slice is . It follows that the area of the region bounded by the two curves is . Evaluating the integral, we find .    Solving , we find that the two curves intersect where , so at . We can plot the region as shown in the figure below.     Slicing the region with thin vertical rectangles, a typical rectangle's height is given by , and thus the area of such a slice is . Hence, the area of the region bounded by the two curves is . Evaluating the integral, we find .    The first positive value at which the sine and cosine functions intersect is . Plotting the functions in a surrounding region, we see the following figure.     Slicing the region with vertical rectangles, we find the area of the shaded region is given by .    The curves and intersect at three points, forming two regions. Setting and solving, we find that , which implies that or . Plotting the curves, we see that for the left-hand region, the relative interval is and .     Thus, the left-hand region has area . For the right-hand region, the interval is and , so that its area is .         Finding Area with Horizontal Slices  At times, the shape of a region may dictate that we use horizontal rectangular slices, instead of vertical ones.    Find the area of the region bounded by the parabola and the line , shown at left in Figure .   The area bounded by the functions and (at left), with the region sliced vertically (center) and horizontally (at right).      By solving the second equation for and writing , we find that . Hence the curves intersect where . Thus, we find or , so the intersection points of the two curves are and .  If we attempt to use vertical rectangles to slice up the area (as in the center graph of Figure ), we see that from to the curves that bound the top and bottom of the rectangle are one and the same. This suggests, as shown in the rightmost graph in the figure, that we try using horizontal rectangles.  Note that the width of a horizontal rectangle depends on . Between and , the right end of a representative rectangle is determined by the line , and the left end is determined by the parabola, . The thickness of the rectangle is .  Therefore, the area of the rectangle is , and the area between the two curves on the -interval is approximated by the Riemann sum .  Taking the limit of the Riemann sum, it follows that the area of the region is .  We emphasize that we are integrating with respect to ; this is because we chose to use horizontal rectangles whose widths depend on and whose thickness is denoted . It is a straightforward exercise to evaluate the integral in Equation and find that .    Just as with the use of vertical rectangles of thickness , we have a general principle for finding the area between two curves, which we state as follows.   If two curves and intersect at and , and for all such that , , then the area between the curves is .     In each of the following problems, our goal is to determine the area of the region described. For each region, (i) determine the intersection points of the curves, (ii) sketch the region whose area is being found, (iii) draw and label a representative slice, and (iv) state the area of the representative slice. Then, state a definite integral whose value is the exact area of the region, and evaluate the integral to find the numeric value of the region's area. Note well: At the step where you draw a representative slice, you need to make a choice about whether to slice vertically or horizontally.   The finite region bounded by and .    The finite region bounded by and .    The area bounded by the -axis, , and .    The finite regions between the curves and .          Find where the curves intersect and plot them.    Observe that horizontal slices are appropriate, so we will integrate with respect to y.    Note that the region is approximately triangular with the -axis as the base, as the left \"side\", and as the right side.        Plot the region and observe that horizontal slices are appropriate because of the shape of the region.           .     .          .          The two curves intersect when , thus when , so at . Plotting the region, we see that for to , , and thus horizontal slices are appropriate for setting up the integral that represents the region's area. The area is thus given by .    The two curves intersect when , and therefore so . Graphing the region, on , we see that . Using horizontal slices, it follows that the region's area is given by .    The two curves meet at . A careful plot of the region shows that the two curves, together with the -axis, form a roughly triangular region with the -axis as the base, as the left \"side\", and as the right side. Using horizontal slices, and writing each respective equation with as a function of (so and ), we find that the area of this region is     The two curves intersect at and . For , we observe that , so using horizontal slices and the corresponding definite integral, we find that the region's area is .         Finding the length of a curve  arc length  We can also use the definite integral to find the length of a portion of a curve. We use the same fundamental principle: we slice the curve up into small pieces whose lengths we can easily approximate. Specifically, we subdivide the curve into small approximating line segments, as shown at left in Figure .   At left, a continuous function whose length we seek on the interval to . At right, a close up view of a portion of the curve.    We estimate the length of each portion of the curve on a small interval of length . We use the right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes and hypotenuse connecting the endpoints of the slice, as seen at right in Figure . The length, , of the hypotenuse approximates the length, , of the curve between the two selected points. Thus, .  Next we use algebra to rearrange the expression for the length of the hypotenuse into a form that we can integrate. By removing a factor of , we find .  Then, as and , we have that . Thus, we can say that .  Taking a Riemann sum of all of these slices and letting , we arrive at the following fact.   Given a differentiable function on an interval , the total arc length, arc length  , along the curve from to is given by .     Each of the following questions somehow involves the arc length along a curve.   Use the definition and appropriate computational technology to determine the arc length along from to .    Find the arc length of on the interval . Find this value in two different ways: (a) by using a definite integral, and (b) by using a familiar property of the curve.    Determine the arc length of on the interval .    Will the integrals that arise calculating arc length typically be ones that we can evaluate exactly using the First FTC, or ones that we need to approximate? Why?    A moving particle is traveling along the curve given by , and does so at a constant rate of 7 cm\/sec, where both and are measured in cm (that is, the curve is the path along which the object actually travels; the curve is not a position function ). Find the position of the particle when sec, assuming that when , the particle's location is .          Recall that .    Remember that generates a circle centered at of radius 4.    Apply the arc length formula. Use technology to evaluate the integral.    Most expressions involving square roots are difficult to antidifferentiate.    Here you can determine the arc length and then experiment to find the upper limit of integration, which will help you determine position.           .     .     .    We will usually have to estimate the value of using computational technology.    Approximately .          Using the formula for arc length, we know . Evaluating the integral, we find .    The curve is a semi-circle of radius 2, so its length must be . This is confirmed by the arc length formula, since , so  . It follows This integral is actually \"improper\" because the integrand is undefined at the endpoints, . We will learn how to evaluate such integrals in Section . that .    For , we observe that , and that . Thus, the arc length of the curve on is .    Because will rarely simplify nicely and rarely have an elementary antiderivative, we will usually have to estimate the value of using computational technology.    After 4 seconds traveling at 7 cm\/sec, the particle has moved 28 cm. So, we have to find the value of for which the arc length along is 28. Thus, we know that . Rewriting the integral, we see . Experimenting with different values of in a computational engine like WolframAlpha, we find that for , , and thus the position of the particle when is approximately .         Summary     To find the area between two curves, we think about slicing the region into thin rectangles. If, for instance, the area of a typical rectangle on the interval to is given by , then the exact area of the region is given by the definite integral .    The shape of the region usually dictates whether we should use vertical rectangles of thickness or horizontal rectangles of thickness . We want the height of the rectangle given by the difference between two curves: if those curves are best thought of as functions of , we use horizontal rectangles, whereas if those curves are best viewed as functions of , we use vertical rectangles.    The arc length, , along the curve from to is given by .

Considering a rightangle triangle with an angle which opposite side has length 9 and adjacent side has length 8, we see that the hypotenues is . Thus and . . Thus, Over the interval , the graph of lies above that of . Hence, the area between the two curves is  Thus the total area is the sum of the above two integrals, which is .

By the quadratic formula, it follows that . Since the curve lies to the right (has a greater value) of between and as shown in the figure below, we see that the area between the two curves is given by the integral . Evaluating this integral, we find that .       As the figure below shows, the graph of lies above the graph of on this interval. So the area between the two curves is given by .       We can rewrite as . The two curves intersect when . It follows that , so and thus factoring, . Hence the two curves intersect when or .

The two curves intersect when , or when . By the quadratic formula, it folows that . If we integrate with vertical slices, then the graph of is always above the graph of and so the area of the region between the two graphs is .          Let and , where is an unknown positive real number. For what value(s) of is the area between the curves and equal to 2?    .   Both of these quadratic functions pass through the points and , and thus these are the two intersection points for all positive values of . In addition, since on , it follows that the area between the curves is given by . Evaluating the integral, we find that . We want to know for which value(s) of it follows that . Thus, we solve , from which it follows that . Hence, in the figure below, the area between the two curves is exactly .       Let .

  "title": "Using Definite Integrals to Find Volume",
  "body": " Using Definite Integrals to Find Volume     How can we use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis?    In what circumstances do we integrate with respect to instead of integrating with respect to ?    What adjustments do we need to make if we revolve about a line other than the - or -axis?      Just as we can use definite integrals to add the areas of rectangular slices to find the exact area that lies between two curves, we can also use integrals to find the volume of regions whose cross-sections have a particular shape.  In particular, we can determine the volume of solids whose cross-sections are all thin cylinders (or washers) by adding up the volumes of these individual slices. We first consider a familiar shape in Preview Activity : a circular cone.   Consider a circular cone of radius 3 and height 5, which we view horizontally as pictured in Figure . Our goal in this activity is to use a definite integral to determine the volume of the cone.   The circular cone described in Preview Activity       Find a formula for the linear function that is pictured in Figure .    For the representative slice of thickness that is located horizontally at a location (somewhere between and ), what is the radius of the representative slice? Note that the radius depends on the value of .    What is the volume of the representative slice you found in (b)?    What definite integral will sum the volumes of the thin slices across the full horizontal span of the cone? What is the exact value of this definite integral?    Compare the result of your work in (d) to the volume of the cone that comes from using the formula .        The Volume of a Solid of Revolution  solid of revolution  A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis. For example, the circular cone in Figure is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the portion of the line from to about the -axis. Notice that if we slice a solid of revolution perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the resulting cross-section is a circle.  We first consider solids whose slices are thin cylinders. Recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by .    Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the region bounded by and the -axis is revolved about the -axis.    First, we observe that intersects the -axis at the points and . When we revolve the region about the -axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured in Figure .   The solid of revolution in Example .    We slice the solid into vertical slices of thickness between and . A representative slice is a cylinder of height and radius . Hence, the volume of the slice is .  Using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the representative slices, it follows that .  It is straightforward to evaluate the integral and find that the volume is .    For a solid such as the one in Example , where each slice is a cylindrical disk, we first find the volume of a typical slice (noting particularly how this volume depends on ), and then integrate over the range of -values that bound the solid. Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the volume; if we desire a numeric value for the integral, we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.  This method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution is often called the disk method . disk method    The Disk Method  If is a nonnegative continuous function on , then the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the curve about the -axis over this interval is given by .   A different type of solid can emerge when two curves are involved, as we see in the following example.    Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the finite region that lies between and is revolved about the -axis.    First, we must determine where the curves and intersect. Substituting the expression for from the second equation into the first equation, we find that . Rearranging, it follows that , and the solutions to this equation are and . The curves therefore cross at and .  When we revolve the region about the -axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured at left in Figure .   At left, the solid of revolution in Example . At right, a typical slice with inner radius and outer radius .       Immediately we see a major difference between the solid in this example and the one in Example : here, the three-dimensional solid of revolution isn't solid because it has open space in its center along the axis of revolution. If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we observe that the resulting slice is not a solid disk, but rather a washer , as pictured at right in Figure . At a given location between and , the small radius of the inner circle is determined by the curve , so . Similarly, the big radius comes from the function , and thus .  To find the volume of a representative slice, we compute the volume of the outer disk and subtract the volume of the inner disk. Since , it follows that the volume of a typical slice is .  Using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the respective slices across the integral, we find that .  Evaluating the integral, we find that the volume of the solid of revolution is .    This method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution generated by two curves is often called the washer method . washer method    The Washer Method  If and are nonnegative continuous functions on that satisfy for all in , then the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region between them about the -axis over this interval is given by .     In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis. In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid. It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.   The region bounded by the -axis, the curve , and the line ; revolve about the -axis.

How is this problem different from the one posed in part (b)?          Use slices perpendicular to the -axis.    Note that slices perpendicular to the -axis will be washers.    Find the points where the two curves intersect and draw a labeled graph.    Think about how the solid looks like a donut; what is the outer radius?    Try using slices perpendicular to the -axis.           .     .     .     .     .          A typical slice (perpendicular to the -axis) has radius , and thus the volume of such a slice is . It follows by the disk method that the volume of the solid of revolution is .    A typical slice (perpendicular to the -axis) is a washer with outer radius and inner radius . The volume of such a slice is . It follows by the washer method that the volume of the solid of revolution is .    The curves and intersect at and ; revolving the region about the -axis and taking slices perpendicular to the -axis, we see that a typical slice is a washer with outer radius and inner radius . Hence the volume of a typical slice is . By the washer method, the volume of the solid is .    The curves and intersect at the points ; after we revolve the region about the -axis, cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of rotation are washers with outer radius and inner radius . By the washer method, we see that .    The curve and the line intersect at ; when we revolve the region about the -axis, slices perpendicular to the -axis are disks. Here we see that each disk's radius is a function of and the disks have thickness , so we will need to integrate with respect to and consider the radius function (which comes from solving for in terms of . Note how this is different from the problem in part (b) because of the axis we rotate about and how this forces us to integrate in terms of . A typical slice has volume , and thus by the disk method the total volume is .         Revolving about the -axis  When we revolve a given region about the -axis, the representative slices now have thickness , which means that we must integrate with respect to .    Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the region that lies between and is revolved about the -axis.    These two curves intersect when , hence at the point . When we revolve the region about the -axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured at left in Figure .   At left, the solid of revolution in Example . At right, a typical slice with inner radius and outer radius .       Note that the slices are cylindrical washers only if taken perpendicular to the -axis. We slice the solid horizontally, starting at and proceeding up to . The thickness of a representative slice is , so we must express the integrand in terms of . The inner radius is determined by the curve , so we solve for and get . In the same way, we solve the curve (which governs the outer radius) for in terms of , and hence . Therefore, the volume of a typical slice is .  We use a definite integral to sum the volumes of all the slices from to . The total volume is .  It is straightforward to evaluate the integral and find that .      In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis. In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.

Note that lies below on the interval .    The curve can be equivalently expressed as .    Find the intersection points by writing the second curve as and solving .           .     .     .     .     .          Observe that horizontal slices with thickness are all cylindrical disks, each with radius given by since they are given by the curve , which can be equivalently expressed as . The volume of each slice is thus . The volume of the solid is thus given by the definite integral .    Slicing perpendicular to the axis of rotation, we get slices of thickness that are shaped like washers. The outer radius, , is given by ; the innner radius is given by the function , but expressed with as a function of , so . It follows that a representative washer slice has volume . Further, since and intersect at the point , we integrate from to and thus find that the total volume is .    The curves and intersect where , so where . The two nonnegative values of that make this equation true are and , and thus the points and form the boundaries of the region that is being rotated about the -axis.

Summary     We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution which will then be circular disks or washers.    If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are horizontal and of thickness . This leads us to integrate with respect to , as opposed to with respect to when we slice a solid vertically.    If we revolve about a line other than the - or -axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice. Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.       Solid of revolution from one function about the -axis   The region bounded by is rotated around the -axis.

Revolving around the -axis, we can use the disk method with slices perpendicular to the -axis to find the volume of the resulting region. Noting that the radius of each such disk is and the width of each such disk is , we know the volume of each slice is and thus the total volume is     If we instead revolve around the -axis, we need to use horizontal disks of thickness in order to apply the disk method.

  "title": "Density, Mass, and Center of Mass",
  "body": " Density, Mass, and Center of Mass     How are mass, density, and volume related?    How is the mass of an object with varying density computed?    What is the center of mass of an object, and how are definite integrals used to compute it?      Studying the units on the integrand and variable of integration helps us understand the meaning of a definite integral. For instance, if is the velocity of an object moving along an axis, measured in feet per second, and measures time in seconds, then both the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation, , have units given by the product of the units of and : . Thus, measures the total change in position of the moving object in feet.  Unit analysis will be particularly helpful to us in what follows.   In each of the following scenarios, we consider the distribution of a quantity along an axis.   Suppose that the function models the density of traffic on a straight road, measured in cars per mile, where is number of miles east of a major interchange, and consider the definite integral .   What are the units on the product ?    What are the units on the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation given by     Evaluate the definite integral and write one sentence to explain the meaning of the value you find.       On a 6 foot long shelf filled with books, the function models the distribution of the weight of the books, in pounds per inch, where is the number of inches from the left end of the bookshelf. Let be given by the rule .   What are the units on the product ?    What are the units on the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation given by     Evaluate the definite integral and write one sentence to explain the meaning of the value you find.           Density  density  The mass  mass of a quantity, typically measured in metric units such as grams or kilograms, is a measure of the amount of the quantity. In a corresponding way, the density of an object measures the distribution of mass per unit volume. For instance, if a brick has mass 3 kg and volume 0.002 m , then the density of the brick is .  As another example, the mass density of water is 1000 kg\/m . Each of these relationships demonstrate the following general principle.   For an object of constant density , with mass and volume , .   But what happens when the density is not constant?  The formula is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used in our work: for a body moving in a fixed direction, distance = rate time, and, for a rectangle, its area is given by . These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved, such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle, are constant . When these quantities are not constant, we have turned to the definite integral for assistance. By working with small slices on which the quantity of interest (such as velocity) is approximately constant, we can use a definite integral to add up the values on the pieces.  For example, if we have a nonnegative velocity function that is not constant, over a short time interval we know that the distance traveled is approximately , since is almost constant on a small interval. Similarly, if we are thinking about the area under a nonnegative function whose value is changing, on a short interval the area under the curve is approximately the area of the rectangle whose height is and whose width is : . Both of these principles are represented visually in Figure .   At left, estimating a small amount of distance traveled, , and at right, a small amount of area under the curve, .    In a similar way, if the density of some object is not constant, we can use a definite integral to compute the overall mass of the object. We will focus on problems where the density varies in only one dimension, say along a single axis.  Let's consider a thin bar of length whose left end is at the origin, where , and assume that the bar has constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm . We let represent the mass density function of the bar, measured in grams per cubic centimeter. That is, given a location , tells us approximately how much mass will be found in a one-centimeter wide slice of the bar at .   A thin bar of constant cross-sectional area 1 cm with density function g\/cm .    The volume of a thin slice of the bar of width , as pictured in Figure , is the cross-sectional area times . Since the cross-sections each have constant area 1 cm , it follows that the volume of the slice is cm . And because mass is the product of density and volume, we see that the mass of this slice is approximately .  The corresponding Riemann sum (and the integral that it approximates), , therefore measure the mass of the bar between and . (The Riemann sum is an approximation, while the integral will be the exact mass.)  For objects whose cross-sectional area is constant and whose mass is distributed relative to horizontal location, , it makes sense to think of the density function with units mass per unit length, such as g\/cm. Thus, when we compute on a small slice , the resulting units are g\/cm cm = g, which thus measures the mass of the slice. The general principle follows.   For an object of constant cross-sectional area whose mass is distributed along a single axis according to the function (whose units are units of mass per unit of length), the total mass, , of the object between and is given by .     Consider the following situations in which mass is distributed in a non-constant manner.   Suppose that a thin rod with constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm has its mass distributed according to the density function , where is the distance in cm from the left end of the rod, and the units on are g\/cm. If the rod is 10 cm long, determine the exact mass of the rod.    Consider the cone that has a base of radius 4 m and a height of 5 m. Picture the cone lying horizontally with the center of its base at the origin and think of the cone as a solid of revolution.   Write and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the volume of the cone.    Next, suppose that the cone has uniform density of 800 kg\/m . What is the mass of the solid cone?    Now suppose that the cone's density is not uniform, but rather that the cone is most dense at its base. In particular, assume that the density of the cone is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base, but that in each such cross section that is a distance units from the origin, the density of the cross section is given by the function , measured in kg\/m . Determine and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the mass of this cone of non-uniform density. Do so by first thinking about the mass of a given slice of the cone units away from the base; remember that in such a slice, the density will be essentially constant .       Let a thin rod of constant cross-sectional area 1 cm and length 12 cm have its mass be distributed according to the density function , measured in g\/cm. Find the exact location at which to cut the bar so that the two pieces will each have identical mass.          Remember that .    Think about slices: what's the volume of a slice? what's the mass of a slice?    Consider .           grams.          .     .             .          Since the mass, , is given by , it follows that , and hence grams.    Consider the cone that has a base of radius 4 m and a height of 5 m.     With the cone having its base centered at the origin and being a solid of revolution about the -axis, the cone is generated by the line . Using the disk method, it follows that the cone's volume is .    Since the cone has uniform density 800 kg\/m , we know that the cone's mass is the product of its density and volume, and thus .    Since cone has non-uniform density, but is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base such that each cross section a distance units from the origin has its density given by kg\/m , we naturally consider slices of the cone that are perpendicular to the -axis. For each such slice, the radius is , which makes the volume of the slice . Since the density is constant on the slice with value , it follows that the mass of the slice is . Using a definite integral to let and add up the values of all of the slices, we thus find the mass of the cone with this density distribution to be .       The total mass of the bar is given by . To find where to cut the bar in two so that the two pieces have equal mass, we have to determine the value of such that . Since , we need to have satisfy the equation . Thus, , so . It follows that , so .         Weighted Averages  The concept of an average is a natural one, and one that we have used repeatedly as part of our understanding of the meaning of the definite integral. If we have values , , , , we know that their average is given by , and for a quantity being measured by a function on an interval , the average value of the quantity on is .  As we continue to think about problems involving the distribution of mass, it is natural to consider the idea of a weighted average, weighted average where certain quantities involved are counted more in the average.   A common use of weighted averages is in the computation of a student's GPA, where grades are weighted according to credit hours. Let's consider the scenario in Table .   A college student's semester grades.        class  grade  grade points  credits    chemistry  B+  3.3  5    calculus  A-  3.7  4    history  B-  2.7  3    psychology  B-  2.7  3      If all of the classes were of the same weight (i.e., the same number of credits), the student's GPA would simply be calculated by taking the average .  But since the chemistry and calculus courses have higher weights (of 5 and 4 credits respectively), we actually compute the GPA according to the weighted average .  The weighted average reflects the fact that chemistry and calculus, as courses with higher credits, have a greater impact on the students' grade point average. Note particularly that in the weighted average, each grade gets multiplied by its weight, and we divide by the sum of the weights.  In the following activity, we explore further how weighted averages can be used to find the balancing point of a physical system.    For quantities of equal weight, such as two children on a teeter-totter, the balancing point is found by taking the average of their locations. When the weights of the quantities differ, we use a weighted average of their respective locations to find the balancing point.   Suppose that a shelf is 6 feet long, with its left end situated at . If one book of weight 1 lb is placed at , and another book of weight 1 lb is placed at , what is the location of , the point at which the shelf would (theoretically) balance on a fulcrum?    Now, say that we place four books on the shelf, each weighing 1 lb: at , at , at , and at . Find , the balancing point of the shelf.    How does change if we change the location of the third book? Say the locations of the 1-lb books are , , , and .    Next, suppose that we place four books on the shelf, but of varying weights: at a 2-lb book, at a 3-lb book, at a 1-lb book, and at a 1-lb book. Use a weighted average of the locations to find , the balancing point of the shelf. How does the balancing point in this scenario compare to that found in (b)?    What happens if we change the location of one of the books? Say that we keep everything the same in (d), except that . How does change?    What happens if we change the weight of one of the books? Say that we keep everything the same in (d), except that the book at now weighs 2 lbs. How does change?    Experiment with a couple of different scenarios of your choosing where you move one of the books to the left, or you decrease the weight of one of the books.    Write a couple of sentences to explain how adjusting the location of one of the books or the weight of one of the books affects the location of the balancing point of the shelf. Think carefully here about how your changes should be considered relative to the location of the balancing point of the current scenario.          Find the average location.    Note that you are averaging 4 locations.    Compare (b).    If the book at location weighs 2 pounds, it's like there are two books at , so must play a role in the average.    Use a weighted average.    Compare (e).    Experiment.    Compare the effects of moving locations left and adding weight to the left of the balancing point.           .     .     .     .     .     .    Answers will vary.    If we have an existing arrangement and balancing point, moving one of the locations to the left will move the balancing point to the left; similarly, moving one of the locations to the right will move the balancing point to the right. If instead we add weight to an existing location, if that location is left of the balancing point, the balancing point will move left; the behavior is similar if on the right.          The shelf will balance at .    The shelf will balance at the average of the locations: .    Changing the location of to the left will move the average to the left, so the new location for is .    We can think of the weighted books almost as if there were that number of 1-lb books at each location. The balancing point is given by the weighted average . Note particularly that we divide by the total weight of the books, not the total number.    Here we find , which moves the balancing point slightly to the right.    In this situation, we find the balancing point also moves to the right: .    Try, for instance, having and and experiment with different weights.    If we have an existing arrangement and balancing point, moving one of the locations to the left will move the balancing point to the left; similarly, moving one of the locations to the right will move the balancing point to the right. If instead we add weight to an existing location, if that location is left of the balancing point, the balancing point will move left; the behavior is similar if on the right.         Center of Mass  In Activity , we saw that the balancing point of a system of point-masses In the activity, we actually used weight rather than mass . Since weight is proportional to mass, the computations for the balancing point result in the same location regardless of whether we use weight or mass. The gravitational constant is present in both the numerator and denominator of the weighted average. (such as books on a shelf) is found by taking a weighted average of their respective locations. In the activity, we were computing the center of mass of a system of masses distributed along an axis, which is the balancing point of the axis on which the masses rest.   Center of Mass (point-masses)  For a collection of masses , , that are distributed along a single axis at the locations , , , the center of mass center of mass (point-masses is given by .   Now consider a thin bar over which density is distributed continuously. If the density is constant, it is obvious that the balancing point of the bar is its midpoint. But if density is not constant, we must compute a weighted average. Let's say that the function tells us the density distribution along the bar, measured in g\/cm. If we slice the bar into small sections, we can think of the bar as holding a collection of adjacent point-masses. The mass of a slice of thickness at location , is .  If we slice the bar into pieces, we can approximate its center of mass by . Rewriting the sums in sigma notation, we have .  The greater the number of slices, the more accurate our estimate of the balancing point will be. The sums in Equation can be viewed as Riemann sums, so in the limit as , we find that the center of mass is given by the quotient of two integrals.   Center of Mass (continuous mass distribution)  For a thin rod of density distributed along an axis from to , the center of mass center of mass (continuous mass distribution) of the rod is given by .   Note that the denominator of is the mass of the bar, and that this quotient of integrals is simply the continuous version of the weighted average of locations, , along the bar.    Consider a thin bar of length 20 cm whose density is distributed according to the function , where represents the left end of the bar. Assume that is measured in g\/cm and is measured in cm.   Find the total mass, , of the bar.    Without doing any calculations, do you expect the center of mass of the bar to be equal to 10, less than 10, or greater than 10? Why?    Compute , the exact center of mass of the bar.    What is the average density of the bar?    Now consider a different density function, given by , also for a bar of length 20 cm whose left end is at . Plot both and on the same axes. Without doing any calculations, which bar do you expect to have the greater center of mass? Why?    Compute the exact center of mass of the bar described in (e) whose density function is . Check the result against the prediction you made in (e).          Recall .    Think about whether there's more mass to the left of 10 or to the right of 10.    Use the formula just developed in the preceding subsection of the text.    Recall that when density, is constant, .    Think about how the two density functions distribute mass. Note that they appear to distribute the same total mass, as the areas under the two curves appear to be equal.    Use in place of in standard calculations.           g.    Greater than 10.     .    5 g\/cm.    Slightly to the right of the center of mass for .     ,           g.    The center of mass will be greater than 10 since the mass is more concentrated as increases.    Using the formula we developed, , so , which is indeed just greater than 10.    Recall that average density is given by mass divided by length, so since the bar is 20 cm long and its mass is 100 g, the average density is 100\/20 = 5 g\/cm. This can also be computed using the formula for average value of a function: .    Since lies below up until where they intersect at about , after which , we see that distributes mass more to the right. It also appears as if the two curves may bound the same total area, and thus the generate the same total mass. If that is the case, we expect for to lie slightly to the right of the center of mass for .    We see that , which is indeed slightly right of for .         Summary     For an object of constant density , with volume and mass , we know that .    If an object with constant cross-sectional area (such as a thin bar) has its density distributed along an axis according to the function , then we can find the mass of the object between and by .    For a system of point-masses distributed along an axis, say at locations , the center of mass, , is given by the weighted average . If instead we have mass continuously distributed along an axis, such as by a density function for a thin bar of constant cross-sectional area, the center of mass of the portion of the bar between and is given by . In each situation, represents the balancing point of the system of masses or of the portion of the bar.       Center of mass for a linear density function   A rod has length 4 meters. At a distance meters from its left end, the density of the rod is given by g\/m.  (a) Complete the Riemann sum for the total mass of the rod (use in place of ):  mass =   (b) Convert the Riemann sum to an integral and find the exact mass.  mass =  (include help (units) )             (a) Suppose we choose an , . If is a small fraction of a meter, then the density of the rod is approximately anywhere from to meters from the left end of the rod. The mass of the rod from to meters is therefore approximately . If we slice the rod into pieces, then a Riemann sum is , or, more loosely, . (b) The definite integral is       Center of mass for a nonlinear density function   A rod with uniform density (mass\/unit length) lies on the -axis between and Find the mass and center of mass of the rod.  mass =  center of mass =             The center of mass is       Interpreting the density of cars on a road   Suppose that the density of cars (in cars per mile) down a 20-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is approximated by at a distance miles from the Breezewood toll plaza. Sketch a graph of this function for .  (a) Complete the Riemann sum that approximates the total number of cars on this 20-mile stretch (use instead of ):  Number =  (b) Find the total number of cars on the 20-mile stretch.  Number =             (a) Suppose we choose an , . We approximate the density of the number of the cars between and miles as cars per mile. Therefore, the number of cars between and is approximately . If we slice the 20 mile strip into slices, we get that the total number of cars is where . This is a right-hand approximation; the corresponding left-hand approximation is . We can more loosely write both approximations without referring to the number of steps as  (b) As the Riemann sum above approaches the integral If we calculate the integral numerically, we find . We can also find the integral exactly as follows:  Let so and . Then (To find the integral we used the appropriate entry in a table of integrals.) Using this, we have , which matches our numerical approximation.      Center of mass in a point-mass system   A point mass of 1 grams located 7 centimeters to the left of the origin and a point mass of 4 grams located 8 centimeters to the right of the origin are connected by a thin, light rod. Find the center of mass of the system.  Center of Mass =    to the left of the origin    to the right of the origin    (at the origin)    (include help (units) in your center of mass)                    Let a thin rod of length have density distribution function , where is measured in cm and in grams per centimeter.   If the mass of the rod is 30 g, what is the value of ?    For the 30g rod, will the center of mass lie at its midpoint, to the left of the midpoint, or to the right of the midpoint? Why?    For the 30g rod, find the center of mass, and compare your prediction in (b).    At what value of should the 30g rod be cut in order to form two pieces of equal mass?          .    Left of the midpoint.     .     cm.         To find mass we slice the rod horizontally into uniform slices of length and approximate the density on the th slice with the constant density . Then the approximate mass of the th slice is . Adding the approximations and taking the limit as the number of slices goes to infinity gives us the definite integral to represent the mass of the rod. Using the substitution and we have . So if the mass is g, then , so , and . It follows that , and thus, .    Since the density is a decreasing function, we should expect that the center of mass of the rod will lie to the left of the midpoint.    To find the center of mass, we slice the rod horizontally into uniform slices of length and approximate the mass on the th slice with the constant density to be as in (a). The position of the th slice is approximately . Treating the rod as a collection of discrete masses (the slices), the center of mass is approximately . Letting the number of slices go to infinity gives us the exact location of the center of mass of the rod, . The mass of the rod is g, so now we just need to evaluate . Integrating by parts with , , , and gives us . So the center of mass is , which is less than midway across the cm rod as expected.    Each piece would have mass grams. Let be a value of between 0 and so the the mass of the rod on the interval is 15. Using the substitution and we have that the mass of the rod on the interval is We want this mass to be grams, so we find such that . Solving for in the usual way, we find cm. Note that this is not the same as the center of mass.

Although the computations prove the conclusion, the result is also intuitive: the average treats the two bars as equal contributors and doesn't take into account that one bar has much more mass than the other. Indeed, a weighted average is needed to correctly compute the center of mass, which is what our earlier computations in (i) and (ii) accomplish.          Consider the curve given by .

We use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution. In the usual way, the volume of a typical slice is and thus using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the slices, we get . Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find that cubic inches.    Given that the bat has (constant) weight density ounces per cubic inch, it follows that the total weight of the bat is ounces.    If we slice the baseball bat perpendicular to the horizontal axes, we get thin cylindrical disks as cross-sections. At a given -location, the amount of weight concentrated there is approximately the weight density ( ounces per cubic inch) times the volume of the slice, which is . Thus, we see that the amount of weight concentrated at a location along the bat is given by , which we can therefore view as being the weight density function for how the weight of the baseball bat is distributed from to .    Even though we are dealing with ``weight'' instead of ``mass'', we can compute the center of mass in the usual way since weight differs from mass only by the gravitational constant, and this constant is present in both the numerator and denominator of the center of mass.

What is the total force exerted by water against a dam?    How are both of the above concepts and their corresponding use of definite integrals similar to problems we have encountered in the past involving formulas such as distance equals rate times time and mass equals density times volume ?       Three settings where we compute the accumulation of a varying quantity: the area under , the distance traveled by an object with velocity , and the mass of a bar with density function .    We have seen several different circumstances where the definite integral enables us to measure the accumulation of a quantity that varies, provided the quantity is approximately constant over small intervals. For instance, to find the area bounded by a nonnegative curve and the -axis on an interval , we take a representative slice of width that has area . As we let the width of the representative slice tend to zero, we find that the exact area of the region is .  In a similar way, if we know the velocity of a moving object and we wish to know the distance the object travels on an interval where is nonnegative, we can use a definite integral to generalize the fact that when the rate, , is constant. On a short time interval , is roughly constant, so for a small slice of time, . As the width of the time interval tends to zero, the exact distance traveled is given by the definite integral .  Finally, if we want to determine the mass of an object of non-constant density, because (mass equals density times volume, provided that density is constant), we can consider a small slice of an object on which the density is approximately constant, and a definite integral may be used to determine the exact mass of the object. For instance, if we have a thin rod whose cross sections have constant density, but whose density is distributed along the axis according to the function , it follows that for a small slice of the rod that is thick, . In the limit as , we then find that the total mass is given by .  All three of these situations are similar in that we have a basic rule ( , , ) where one of the two quantities being multiplied is no longer constant; in each, we consider a small interval for the other variable in the formula, calculate the approximate value of the desired quantity (area, distance, or mass) over the small interval, and then use a definite integral to sum the results as the length of the small intervals is allowed to approach zero. It should be apparent that this approach will work effectively for other situations where we have a quantity that varies.  We next turn to the notion of work : work from physics, a basic principle is that work is the product of force and distance. For example, if a person exerts a force of 20 pounds to lift a 20-pound weight 4 feet off the ground, the total work accomplished is .  If force and distance are measured in English units (pounds and feet), then the units of work are foot-pounds . foot-pound If we work in metric units, where forces are measured in Newtons and distances in meters, the units of work are Newton-meters . Newton-meter   Of course, the formula only applies when the force is constant over the distance . In Preview Activity , we explore one way that we can use a definite integral to compute the total work accomplished when the force exerted varies.   A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well; its weight (including the water), , in pounds at a height feet above the water is given by the function . When the bucket leaves the water, the bucket and water together weigh pounds, and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, pounds. Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate (as a function of height, ) throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.   Find a formula for .    Compute the value of the product , where feet. Include units on your answer. Explain why this product represents the approximate work it took to move the bucket of water from to .    Is the value in (b) an over- or under-estimate of the actual amount of work it took to move the bucket from to ? Why?    Compute the value of the product , where feet. Include units on your answer. What is the meaning of the value you found?    More generally, what does the quantity measure for a given value of and a small positive value of ?    Evaluate the definite integral . What is the meaning of the value you find? Why?        Work  work  Because work is calculated by the rule whenever the force is constant, it follows that we can use a definite integral to compute the work accomplished by a varying force. For example, suppose that a bucket whose weight at height is given by is being lifted in a 50-foot well.  In contrast to the problem in the preview activity, this bucket is not leaking at a constant rate; but because the weight of the bucket and water is not constant, we have to use a definite integral to determine the total work done in lifting the bucket. At a height above the water, the approximate work to move the bucket a small distance is .  Hence, if we let tend to 0 and take the sum of all of the slices of work accomplished on these small intervals, it follows that the total work is given by .  While it is a straightforward exercise to evaluate this integral exactly using the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in applied settings such as this one we will typically use computing technology. Here, it turns out that foot-pounds.  Our work in Preview Activity and in the most recent discussion above employs the following important general principle.   For an object being moved in the positive direction along an axis with location by a force , the total work to move the object from to is given by .     Consider the following situations in which a varying force accomplishes work.     Suppose that a heavy rope hangs over the side of a cliff. The rope is 200 feet long and weighs 0.3 pounds per foot; initially the rope is fully extended. How much work is required to haul in the entire length of the rope? (Hint: set up a function whose value is the weight of the rope remaining over the cliff after feet have been hauled in.)    A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well. When lifted from the water, the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds. As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate, the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot. What function tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted feet? What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?    Now suppose that the bucket in (b) does not leak at a constant rate, but rather that its weight at a height feet above the water is given by . What is the total work required to lift the bucket 100 feet? What is the average force exerted on the bucket on the interval to ?    From physics, Hooke's Law  Hooke's Law for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length. That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring units from its natural length is for some constant (which is called the spring constant .) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet. Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1\/3 foot) beyond its natural length.     Use the given fact that to find the spring constant .    Find the work done to extend the spring from its natural length to 1 foot beyond its natural length.    Find the work required to extend the spring from 1 foot beyond its natural length to 1.5 feet beyond its natural length.             Find a linear function that satisfies and     The weight of the bucket is given by a linear function.    Recall that work is given by a certain definite integral.    Follow the rule for Hooke's Law and then use .           .     .     .    For the given spring,    .     .     .             When the full rope is extended over the cliff, the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds. Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds; in addition, the quantity measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when feet of rope have been pulled in. This means that the function whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after feet have been pulled in is given by . When a small amount of rope, , is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by . Thus, the total work to pull in the 200 feet of rope is given by .    Since changes at a constant rate, is a linear function. We know that and that loses weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot of rope hauled in. Thus, . It follows that the total work to life the leaky bucket 100 feet is .    Given that is the weight of the bucket when feet of rope have been pulled in, it follows that the total work to move the bucket 100 feet is . In addition, the average force that was exerted on the bucket is precisely the average weight of the bucket, which is .    Now considering the given spring,   Since and by Hoooke's Law, it follows that , and thus .    Because the work to stretch the spring 1 foot is given by , it follows .    Here, .            Work: Pumping Liquid from a Tank  In certain geographic locations where the water table is high, residential homes with basements have a peculiar feature: in the basement, one finds a large hole in the floor, and in the hole, there is water. For example, in Figure we see a sump crock Image credit to www.warreninspect.com\/basement-moisture . . A sump crock provides an outlet for water that may build up beneath the basement floor to prevent flooding the basement.   In the crock we see a floating pump. This pump is activated by elevation, so when the water level reaches a particular height, the pump turns on and pumps water out of the crock, hence relieving the water buildup beneath the foundation. One of the questions we'd like to answer is: how much work does a sump pump accomplish?   A sump crock.       Suppose that a sump crock has the shape of a frustum of a cone, as pictured in Figure . The crock has a diameter of 3 feet at its surface, a diameter of 1.5 feet at its base, and a depth of 4 feet. In addition, suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window. To accomplish this, the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock. How much work is required to empty the sump crock if it is initially completely full?   A sump crock with approximately cylindrical cross-sections.      It is helpful to think of the depth below the surface of the crock as being the independent variable, so we let the positive -axis point down, and the positive -axis to the right, as pictured in the figure. Because the pump sits on the surface of the water, it makes sense to think about the pump moving the water one slice at a time, where it takes a thin slice from the surface, pumps it out of the tank, and then proceeds to pump the next slice below.  Each slice of water is cylindrical in shape. We see that the radius of each slice varies according to the linear function that passes through the points and , where is the depth of the particular slice in the tank; it is a straightforward exercise to find that . Now we think about the problem in several steps:  determining the volume of a typical slice;  finding the weight We assume that the weight density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. of a typical slice (and thus the force that must be exerted on it);  deciding the distance that a typical slice moves;  and computing the work to move a representative slice.  Once we know the work it takes to move one slice, we use a definite integral over an appropriate interval to find the total work.  Consider a representative cylindrical slice at a depth of feet below the top of the crock. The approximate volume of that slice is given by .  Since water weighs 62.4 lb\/ft , the approximate weight of a representative slice is . This is also the approximate force the pump must exert to move the slice.  Because the slice is located at a depth of feet below the top of the crock, the slice being moved by the pump must move feet to get to the level of the basement floor, and then, as stated in the problem description, another 9 feet to reach the drain at ground level. Hence, the total distance a representative slice travels is .  Finally, the work to move a representative slice is given by .  We sum the work required to move slices throughout the tank (from to ), let , and hence . When evaluated using appropriate technology, the integral shows that the total work is foot-pounds.    The preceding example demonstrates the standard approach to finding the work required to empty a tank filled with liquid. The main task in each such problem is to determine the volume of a representative slice, followed by the force exerted on the slice, as well as the distance such a slice moves. In the case where the units are metric, there is one key difference: in the metric setting, rather than weight, we normally first find the mass of a slice. For instance, if distance is measured in meters, the mass density of water is 1000 kg\/m . In that setting, we can find the mass of a typical slice (in kg). To determine the force required to move it, we use , where is the object's mass and is the gravitational constant N\/kg. That is, in metric units, the weight density of water is 9810 N\/m .    In each of the following problems, determine the total work required to accomplish the described task. In parts (b) and (c), a key step is to find a formula for a function that describes the curve that forms the side boundary of the tank.   A trough with triangular ends, as described in Activity , part (c).       Consider a vertical cylindrical tank of radius 2 meters and depth 6 meters. Suppose the tank is filled with 4 meters of water of mass density 1000 kg\/m , and the top 1 meter of water is pumped over the top of the tank.    Consider a hemispherical tank with a radius of 10 feet. Suppose that the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet with water of weight density 62.4 pounds\/ft , and the top 5 feet of water are pumped out of the tank to a tanker truck whose height is 5 feet above the top of the tank.    Consider a trough with triangular ends, as pictured in Figure , where the tank is 10 feet long, the top is 5 feet wide, and the tank is 4 feet deep. Say that the trough is full to within 1 foot of the top with water of weight density 62.4 pounds\/ft , and a pump is used to empty the tank until the water remaining in the tank is 1 foot deep.          Note that slices of water at constant depth are all cylinders and all have the same radius. Also, remember to convert mass to weight when computing force.    Recall that the top half of a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin has equation .    The equation of the line that determines the right side of the front face of the tank is . Note that a slice of water at constant depth is a rectangular slab whose width is .           .     .     .          A typical slice is a thin cylinder of radius 2 and thickness . The volume of such a cylinder is , and its weight is thus . Finally, the distance such a slice travels to the top of the tank is . If we only pump out the top 1 m of water, which corresponds to the water between and because the tank is full to a depth of 4 m, it follows that the total work is .    Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function , and a typical slice has volume . The force to move such a slice is its weight, . Each slice has to move feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is . Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, ranges from (the top of the water) to (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank). Hence, the total work done is .    The line that bounds the right edge of the triangular face of the tank lying in the first quadrant is . If we take a slice of water that lies at depth , note that the slice is rectangular with thickness , length 10 (the tank is 10 feet long), and width . Thus, the volume of a typical slice is , and the force that has to be exerted to move such a slice is . The distance a typical slice moves when pumped to the top of the tank is , and since the tank is full to a depth of 3 feet (within 1 foot of the top) and we are going to empty the tank until 1 foot of water remains in it, we see that we need to integrate from to , so .         Force due to Hydrostatic Pressure  When building a dam, engineers need to know how much force water will exert against the face of the dam. This force comes from water pressure. The pressure a force exerts on a region is measured in units of force per unit of area: for example, the air pressure in a tire is often measured in pounds per square inch (PSI). Hence, we see that the general relationship is given by , where represents pressure, represents force, and the area of the region being considered. Of course, in the equation , we assume that the pressure is constant over the entire region .  We know from experience that the deeper one dives underwater while swimming, the greater the pressure exerted by the water. This is because at a greater depth, there is more water right on top of the swimmer: it is the force that column of water exerts that determines the pressure the swimmer experiences. The total water pressure is found by computing the total weight of the column of water that lies above a region of area 1 square foot at a fixed depth. At a depth of feet, a rectangular column has volume ft , so the corresponding weight of the water overhead is . This is the amount of force being exerted on a 1 square foot region at a depth feet underwater, so the pressure exerted by water at depth is (lbs\/ft ).  Because pressure is force per unit area, or , we can compute the total force from a variable pressure by integrating .    Consider a trapezoid-shaped dam that is 60 feet wide at its base and 90 feet wide at its top, and assume the dam is 25 feet tall with water that rises to within 5 feet of the top of its face. Water weighs 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. How much force does the water exert against the dam?    First, we sketch a picture of the dam, as shown in Figure . Note that, as in problems involving the work to pump out a tank, we let the positive -axis point down.   A trapezoidal dam that is 25 feet tall, 60 feet wide at its base, 90 feet wide at its top, with the water line 5 feet down from the top of its face.    Pressure is constant at a fixed depth, so we consider a slice of water at constant depth on the face, as shown in the figure. The area of this slice is approximately the area of the rectangle pictured. Since the width of that rectangle depends on the variable , we find a formula for the line that represents one side of the dam. It is straightforward to find that . Hence, the approximate area of a representative slice is .  At any point on this slice, the depth is approximately constant, so the pressure can be considered constant. Because the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, the depth of any point on the representative slice is approximately . Now, since pressure is given by , we have that at any point on the slice .  Knowing both the pressure and area, we can find the force the water exerts on the slice. Using , it follows that .  Finally, we use a definite integral to sum the forces over the appropriate range of -values. Since the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, we start at and take slices all the way to the bottom of the dam, where . Hence, .  Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find pounds.      In each of the following problems, determine the total force exerted by water against the surface that is described.   A trough with triangular ends, as described in Activity , part (c).       Consider a rectangular dam that is 100 feet wide and 50 feet tall, and suppose that water presses against the dam all the way to the top.    Consider a semicircular dam with a radius of 30 feet. Suppose that the water rises to within 10 feet of the top of the dam.    Consider a trough with triangular ends, as pictured in Figure , where the tank is 10 feet long, the top is 5 feet wide, and the tank is 4 feet deep. Say that the trough is full to within 1 foot of the top with water of weight density 62.4 pounds\/ft . How much force does the water exert against one of the triangular ends?          Put the center of the top of the dam at the origin and let the positive -axis point down.    With the positive -axis pointing down, the equation for the edge of the semi-circular dam is .    The equation for the line that bounds the right side of the trough is .           .     .     .          We let the positive -axis point down and let be the distance from the top of the dam. The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is . The pressure (in pounds per square foot) at depth is given by . So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is . So the force of the water against the dam is .    We let the positive -axis point down and let be the distance from the top of the dam. We place the top of the dam along the -axis with the center at the origin. So the equation for the semicircle is . The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is . At a given value of , the depth of the water is . So the pressure (in pounds per square foot) at is given by . So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is . So the force of the water against the dam is .    We let the positive -axis point down and let be the distance from the top of the dam. We place the top of the trough along the -axis with the center at the origin. We need the equation for the straight line from the point to the point . The equation for this line is . The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is . At a given value of , the depth of the water is . So the pressure (in pounds per square foot) at is given by . So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is . So the force of the water against the trough is .       Although there are many different formulas involving work, force, and pressure, the fundamental ideas behind these problems are similar to others we've encountered in applications of the definite integral. We slice the quantity of interest into more manageable pieces and then use a definite integral to add them up.    Summary     To measure the work done by a varying force in moving an object, we divide the problem into pieces on which we can use the formula , and then use a definite integral to sum the work done on each piece.    To find the total force exerted by water against a dam, we use the formula to measure the force exerted on a slice that lies at a fixed depth, and then use a definite integral to sum the forces across the appropriate range of depths.    Because work is computed as the product of force and distance (provided force is constant), and the force water exerts on a dam can be computed as the product of pressure and area (provided pressure is constant), problems involving these concepts are similar to earlier problems we did using definite integrals to find distance (via distance equals rate times time ) and mass ( mass equals density times volume ).       Work to empty a conical tank   A tank in the shape of an inverted right circular cone has height 5 meters and radius 4 meters. It is filled with 3 meters of hot chocolate. Find the work required to empty the tank by pumping the hot chocolate over the top of the tank. The density of hot chocolate is Your answer must include the correct help (units) .  Work =        SOLUTION  We think of the tank as made from infinitely many 'infinitesimal' horizontal slices, with the vertical distance an infinitesimal slice of the water is from the bottom of the tank (the vertex of the right circular cone).  A cross section through the vertical center to the side is approximated below (not necessarily to scale).   Now the large right triangle with height 5 and top side length 4 is similar to the right triangle with height and top side length . So or .  Therefore the area of every infinitesimal slice is  .  The infinitesimal slice has volume  , and since mass = density volume, the mass of our infinitesimal slice is where .  So the mass of the slice at is kg. We now must find for each slice.  Each slice at must be lifted a height meters, and . So for each slice is Joules.  And the sum of lifting all of the slices from the bottom ( ) to the top of the water level's depth ( ) is       Work to empty a cylindrical tank   A fuel oil tank is an upright cylinder, buried so that its circular top is 10 feet beneath ground level. The tank has a radius of 4 feet and is 12 feet high, although the current oil level is only 10 feet deep. Calculate the work required to pump all of the oil to the surface. Oil weighs .  Work =  (include help (units) )        below the surface with thickness . We can then calculate the volume of the slab and the work needed to raise this slab to the surface, a distance of .   Integrating the work over all such slabs, we have       Work to empty a rectangular pool   A rectangular swimming pool 50 ft long, 30 ft wide, and 8 ft deep is filled with water to a depth of 6 ft. Use an integral to find the work required to pump all the water out over the top. (Take as the density of water .)  Work =  (include help (units) )        ft above the bottom, a slice of thickness has Since the density of water is lb\/ft , The distance to lift the slice of water at height ft is ft, so the work to move one slice, , is The work done, , to pump all the water is the sum of the work done on the pieces: As , we obtain a definite integral. Since varies from to and , the total work is:       Work to empty a cylindrical tank to differing heights   Water in a cylinder of height 11 ft and radius 4 ft is to be pumped out. The density of water is 62.4 lb\/ft . Find the work required if  (a) The tank is full of water and the water is to be pumped over the top of the tank.  Work =  (include help (units) )  (b) The tank is full of water and the water must be pumped to a height 6 ft above the top of the tank.  Work =  (include help (units) )  (c) The depth of water in the tank is 6 ft and the water must be pumped over the top of the tank.  Work =  (include help (units) )                  (a) We slice the water horizontally. Each slice is a cylindrical slab of radius and thickness , so The density of water is lb\/ft , so Water at a height of ft must be lifted a distance of ft. Plugging in and since varies from to , the total work, , is:  The total work required is . (b) This is the same as part (a) except the water must be lifted a distance of ft. The total work is:  The total work required is . (c) This is the same as part (a) except that varies from to . The total work is:  The total work required is .      Force due to hydrostatic pressure   A lobster tank in a restaurant is 1.25 m long by 0.5 m wide by 90 cm deep. Taking the density of water to be , find the water forces  on the bottom of the tank: Force =  on each of the larger sides of the tank: Force =  on each of the smaller sides of the tank: Force =  (include help (units) for each, and use )                  meters\/sec : Bottom: On the larger sides, And on the smaller sides,          Consider the curve and the portion of its graph that lies in the first quadrant between the -axis and the first positive value of for which . Let denote the region bounded by this portion of , the -axis, and the -axis. Assume that and are each measured in feet.   Picture the coordinate axes rotated degrees clockwise so that the positive -axis points straight down, and the positive -axis points to the right. Suppose that is rotated about the axis to form a solid of revolution, and we consider this solid as a storage tank. Suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of feet with water weighing pounds per cubic foot. Find the amount of work required to lower the water in the tank until it is feet deep, by pumping the water to the top of the tank.    Again picture the coordinate axes rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that the positive -axis points straight down, and the positive -axis points to the right. Suppose that , together with its reflection across the -axis, forms one end of a storage tank that is 10 feet long. Suppose that the resulting tank is filled completely with water weighing pounds per cubic foot. Find a formula for a function that tells the amount of work required to lower the water by feet.    Suppose that the tank described in (b) is completely filled with water. Find the total force due to hydrostatic pressure exerted by the water on one end of the tank.             foot-pounds.     .     pounds.         First, we construct a picture of the tank as described. Below we see a sketch of in the setting where the positive -axis points down; note that this function first crosses the -axis at about . We reflect the curve from the first quadrant across the positive -axis to generate a solid of revolution. Cross-sections perpendicular to the -axis have thickness and are circular disks.     We now suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of feet with water weighing pounds per cubic foot. Since the bottom of the tank is at , being full to a depth of feet means that there is water from to . To find the work done to pump the water until feet remain in the tank (i.e. to a level where ), we have to first find the weight of a typical slice, which requires us to know the volume of such a slice. Observe that for a slice at depth , . Since water weighs pounds per cubic foot, the weight (and thus force to be exerted) of such a slice is . Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move units, and thus work for that slice is . To find the total work accomplished, we use a definite integral to sum the work done on each slice from (the top of the water when the tank is initially full to feet) to (the height of the water after foot has been emptied). Thus, . Evaluating the integral, we find foot-pounds.    If instead we envision the tank not as a solid of revolution but as a trough, where the two-dimensional figure above forms one end of a tank that is 10 feet long, we now have a similar problem but with slices that are thin rectangular slabs, rather than thin cylindrical disks. Note that each such slice is wide, feet long, and thick. Thus, for a slice at depth , . Since water weighs pounds per cubic foot, the weight (and thus force to be exerted) of such a slice is . Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move units, and thus work for that slice is . Assuming that the tank is completely full, to lower the tank by feet, we consider slices from to , and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice, we find that the total work is .    For the trough described in (b), we now seek to find the total hydrostatic force on one of the ends of the tank when it is completely full. First, we note that a typical slice at location will be at a depth of feet below the water and have area . At any point on this slice, which again lies at depth , the pressure exerted is since pressure is the weight density of water times depth. Finally, since , the total force water is exerting on this slice is . Integrating to sum the total force, we find that pounds.       A cylindrical tank, buried on its side, has radius feet and length feet. It is filled completely with water whose weight density is lbs\/ft , and the top of the tank is two feet underground.   Set up, but do not evaluate, an integral expression that represents the amount of work required to empty the top half of the water in the tank to a truck whose tank lies 4.5 feet above ground.    With the tank now only half-full, set up, but do not evaluate an integral expression that represents the total force due to hydrostatic pressure against one end of the tank.          foot-pounds.     pounds.         First, we set up axes and a sketch for one of the ends of the cylindrical tank. It is simplest to let ground level correspond to the (horizontal) -axis with the positive -axis pointing straight down, so that corresponds to ground level and the value of tells us the depth of a particular location. The circular end of the tank has radius and is centered at the point since its top is feet underground. Thus, the equation of that circle is . Solving for , we find the equation of one half of the circle, the half that is pictured at right in the figure below: .     Next, for a slice at depth , its shape is a rectangular slab with thickness . Its length is , and its width is . Thus, the volume of such a slice is . With the water weighing pounds per cubic foot, the weight of (and thus force to be exerted upon) a typical slice is . To move such a slice from its depth feet below the ground to a tank on a truck that's feet above ground, each slice must travel feet, and thus the work to move the slice is . Finally, to empty half the tank, we need to consider slices from to , and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice, we get foot-pounds.    To find the hydrostatic force due to water pressure that is exerted on one end of the tank by the remaining water, we first find the area of a rectangular slice at a location , which is . We note that such a slice lies between and , which is the values of that represent the depths of remaining water from top to bottom. At an in this interval, the slice's depth below the surface of the water is . Thus, since pressure is weight-density times depth, it follows that .

The rope is 200 feet long and weighs 0.3 pounds per foot; initially the rope is fully extended. How much work is required to haul in the entire length of the rope? (Hint: set up a function whose value is the weight of the rope remaining over the cliff after feet have been hauled in.)    A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well. When lifted from the water, the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds.

What is the total work required to lift the bucket 100 feet? What is the average force exerted on the bucket on the interval to ?    From physics, Hooke's Law  Hooke's Law for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length. That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring units from its natural length is for some constant (which is called the spring constant .) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet. Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1\/3 foot) beyond its natural length.     Use the given fact that to find the spring constant .

When the full rope is extended over the cliff, the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds. Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds; in addition, the quantity measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when feet of rope have been pulled in. This means that the function whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after feet have been pulled in is given by . When a small amount of rope, , is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by . Thus, the total work to pull in the 200 feet of rope is given by .    Since changes at a constant rate, is a linear function. We know that and that loses weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot of rope hauled in. Thus, . It follows that the total work to life the leaky bucket 100 feet is .

In addition, suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window. To accomplish this, the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock. How much work is required to empty the sump crock if it is initially completely full?   A sump crock with approximately cylindrical cross-sections.

Consider a representative cylindrical slice at a depth of feet below the top of the crock. The approximate volume of that slice is given by .  Since water weighs 62.4 lb\/ft , the approximate weight of a representative slice is . This is also the approximate force the pump must exert to move the slice.  Because the slice is located at a depth of feet below the top of the crock, the slice being moved by the pump must move feet to get to the level of the basement floor, and then, as stated in the problem description, another 9 feet to reach the drain at ground level. Hence, the total distance a representative slice travels is .  Finally, the work to move a representative slice is given by .

  "body": " Improper Integrals     What are improper integrals and why are they important?    What does it mean to say that an improper integral converges or diverges?    What are some typical improper integrals that we can classify as convergent or divergent?      Another important application of the definite integral measures the likelihood of certain events. For instance, consider a company that manufactures incandescent light bulbs. Based on a large volume of test results, they have determined that the fraction of light bulbs that fail between times and of use (where is measured in months) is given by .  For example, the fraction of light bulbs that fail during their third month of use is given by .  Thus about 14.22% of all lightbulbs fail between and . Clearly we could adjust the limits of integration to measure the fraction of light bulbs that fail during any time period of interest.   A company with a large customer base has a call center that receives thousands of calls a day. After studying the data that represents how long callers wait for assistance, they find that the function models the time customers wait in the following way: the fraction of customers who wait between and minutes is given by .  Use this information to answer the following questions.   Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 5 and 10 minutes.    Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 10 and 20 minutes.    Next, let's study the fraction who wait up to a certain number of minutes:   What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 5 minutes?    What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 10 minutes?    Between 0 and 15 minutes? Between 0 and 20?       Let represent the fraction of callers who wait between and minutes. Find a formula for that involves a definite integral, and then use the First FTC to find a formula for that does not involve a definite integral.    What is the value of the limit ? What is its meaning in the context of the problem?        Improper Integrals Involving Unbounded Intervals  improper integral  In view of the above examples, we see that we may want to integrate over an interval whose upper limit grows without bound. For example, to find the fraction of light bulbs that fail eventually , we wish to find , for which we will also use the notation .  Such an integral can be interpreted as the area of an unbounded region, as pictured at right in Figure .   At left, the area bounded by on the finite interval ; at right, the result of letting . By in the righthand figure, we mean that the region extends to the right without bound.    We call an integral for which the interval of integration is unbounded improper . improper integral unbounded region of integration For instance, the integrals are all improper because they have limits of integration that involve . To evaluate an improper integral we replace it with a limit of proper integrals. That is, .  We first attempt to evaluate using the First FTC, and then evaluate the limit. Is it even possible for the area of an unbounded region to be finite? The following activity explores this issue and others in more detail.    In this activity we explore the improper integrals and .     First we investigate .     Use the First FTC to determine the exact values of , , and . Then, use your computational device to compute a decimal approximation of each result.    Use the First FTC to evaluate the definite integral (which results in an expression that depends on ).    Now, use your work from (ii.) to evaluate the limit given by .       Next, we investigate .   Use the First FTC to determine the exact values of , , and . Then, use your calculator to compute a decimal approximation of each result.    Use the First FTC to evaluate the definite integral (which results in an expression that depends on ).    Now, use your work from (ii.) to evaluate the limit given by .       Plot the functions and on the same coordinate axes for the values . How would you compare their behavior as increases without bound? What is similar? What is different?    How would you characterize the value of ? of ? What does this tell us about the respective areas bounded by these two curves for ?           .         Compare how quickly the curves approach the -axis as .    Remember that as long as .                     .                       .            Both graphs have a vertical asymptote at and for both graphs, the -axis is a horizontal asymptote. However, the graph of will ''approach the -axis faster'' than the graph of .    The area bounded by the graph of , the -axis, and the vertical line is infinite or unbounded. However, The area bounded by the graph of , the -axis, and the vertical line is equal to 2.                     .                       .

The area bounded by the graph of , the -axis, and the vertical line is infinite or unbounded. However, The area bounded by the graph of , the -axis, and the vertical line is equal to 2.         Convergence and Divergence   Activity suggests that is either finite or infinite (or it doesn't exist). With these possibilities in mind, we introduce the following terminology.   If is nonnegative for , then we say that the improper integral  converges  improper integral converges provided that exists and is finite. Otherwise, we say that  diverges . improper integral diverges    We will restrict our interest to improper integrals for which the integrand is nonnegative. Also, we require that , for if does not approach as , then it is impossible for to converge.    Determine whether each of the following improper integrals converges or diverges. For each integral that converges, find its exact value.                             , where is a positive real number           .    Recall that for , as .     .    Compare (c).    Compare (b), after integrating by parts.    Try two cases: and .                                   If , diverges, while if , the integral converges.                                   We assume that is a positive real number. We now use two cases:   (Assume .) In this case, and so and Using this and equation (1), we see that diverges.    (Assume .) In this case, and so and Using this and equation (1), we see that converges to .            Improper Integrals Involving Unbounded Integrands  An integral is also called improper if the integrand is unbounded on the interval of integration. For example, consider . Because has a vertical asymptote at , is not continuous on , and the integral represents the area of the unbounded region shown at right in Figure .   At left, the area bounded by on the finite interval ; at right, the result of letting , where we see that the shaded region will extend vertically without bound.    We address the problem of the integrand being unbounded improper integral unbounded integrand by replacing the improper integral with a limit of proper integrals. For example, to evaluate , we replace with and let approach 0 from the right. Thus, . We evaluate the proper integral , and then take the limit. We will say that the improper integral converges if this limit exists, and diverges otherwise. In this example, we observe that , so the improper integral converges (to the value 2).  We have to be particularly careful with unbounded integrands, for they may arise in ways that may not initially be obvious. Consider, for instance, the integral .  At first glance we might think that we can simply apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by antidifferentiating to get and then evaluating from to . Were we to do so, we would be erroneously applying the FTC because fails to be continuous throughout the interval, as seen in Figure .   The function on an interval including .    Such an incorrect application of the FTC leads to an impossible result ( ), which would itself suggest that something we did must be wrong. Instead, we must address the vertical asymptote at by writing . We then evaluate two separate limits of proper integrals. For instance, doing so for the integral with approaching from the left, we find , since as approaches 2 from the left. Thus, the improper integral diverges; similar work shows that also diverges. From either of these two results, we can conclude that that the original integral, diverges, too.    For each of the following definite integrals, decide whether the integral is improper or not. If the integral is proper, evaluate it using the First FTC. If the integral is improper, determine whether or not the integral converges or diverges; if the integral converges, find its exact value.                                        is undefined at .    This integral is a proper one.     is undefined at .    Be careful about what happens at ; split the original integral into two integrals that involve .     is undefined at .    Recall that you know an antiderivative for .                          diverges.                                    However, each of the improper integrals on the right side of the equation diverges. For example, So dx diverges.                   Summary     An integral can be improper if at least one of or is , making the interval unbounded, or if has a vertical asymptote at for some value of that satisfies . One reason that improper integrals are important is that certain probabilities can be represented by integrals that involve infinite limits.    When we encounter an improper integral, we work to understand it by replacing the improper integral with a limit of proper integrals. For instance, we write , and then work to determine whether the limit exists and is finite. For any improper integral, if the resulting limit of proper integrals exists and is finite, we say the improper integral converges. Otherwise, the improper integral diverges.    An important class of improper integrals is given by where is a positive real number. We can show that this improper integral converges whenever , and diverges whenever . A related class of improper integrals is , which converges for , and diverges for .         An improper integral on a finite interval   Consider the integral If the integral is divergent, type an upper-case \"D\". Otherwise, evaluate the integral.            An improper integral on an infinite interval   Calculate the integral below, if it converges. If it does not converge, enter diverges for your answer.           This integral converges to .      An improper integral involving a ratio of exponential functions   Calculate the integral, if it converges. If it diverges, enter diverges for your answer.          , we have       A subtle improper integral   Calculate the integral, if it converges. If it diverges, enter diverges for your answer.          is undefined at . To evaluate it, we must split the region of integration up into two pieces, from 0 to 2 and from to 0. But notice, As , this goes to infinity and the integral diverges, so our original integral also diverges.      An improper integral involving a ratio of trigonometric functions   Find the area under the curve between and . Enter diverges if the area is not bounded.  area =        . However, the integrand is undefined at , so this is an improper integral. We find However, is undefined as , so this integral diverges. Thus, because the integral diverges, the area is not bounded.       Determine, with justification, whether each of the following improper integrals converges or diverges.                   , where is a positive real number                   Diverges.    Diverges.    Converges to .     diverges if and converges to if .    Diverges.    Converges to .

So we write the improper integral as a limit, then use parts with , , , and to evaluate the definite integral, then take the limit: . The limit has the form , which is indeterminate, so we need to rewrite it in a form in which we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. Now, , and this latter limit is of the form . Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us Returning to our earlier established equality that , this most recent limit shows that the improper integral converges to .       Sometimes we may encounter an improper integral for which we cannot easily evaluate the limit of the corresponding proper integrals. For instance, consider .

  "body": " An Introduction to Differential Equations     What is a differential equation and what kinds of information can it tell us?    How do differential equations arise in the world around us?    What do we mean by a solution to a differential equation?      In previous chapters, we have seen that a function's derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function's rate of change. For instance, an object's velocity tells us the rate of change of that object's position. By integrating the velocity over a time interval, we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval. If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval, we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.  In this chapter, we introduce the concept of differential equations . A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative, which means that it tells us the function's rate of change. Using this information, we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself. Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function. As we'll see, this may be too much to ask in some situations, but we will still be able to make accurate approximations.   The position of a moving object is given by the function , where is measured in feet and in seconds. We determine that the velocity is feet per second.   How much does the position change over the time interval ?    Does this give you enough information to determine , the position at time ? If so, what is ? If not, what additional information would you need to know to determine ?    Suppose you are told that the object's initial position . Determine , the object's position 2 seconds later.    If you are told instead that the object's initial position is , what is ?    If we only know the velocity , is it possible that the object's position at all times is ? Explain how you know.    Are there other possibilities for ? If so, what are they?    If, in addition to knowing the velocity function is , we know the initial position , how many possibilities are there for ?        What is a differential equation?  differential equation  A differential equation is an equation that describes the derivative, or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us. For instance, the equation describes the derivative of a function that is unknown to us.  As many important examples of differential equations involve quantities that change in time, the independent variable in our discussion will frequently be time . In the preview activity, we considered the differential equation .  Knowing the velocity and the starting position of a moving object, we were able to find its position at any later time.  Because differential equations describe the derivative of a function, they give us information about how that function changes. Our goal will be to use this information to predict the value of the function in the future; in this way, differential equations provide us with something like a crystal ball.  Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world. For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:    Your money will grow at a 3% annual interest rate with us.    This innocuous statement is really a differential equation. Let's translate: will be amount of money you have in your account at time . The rate at which your money grows is the derivative , and we are told that this rate is . This leads to the differential equation .  This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation . In the earlier example, the rate of change depends only on the independent variable , and we may find by integrating the velocity . In the banking example, however, the rate of change depends on the dependent variable , so we'll need some new techniques in order to find .    Express the following statements as differential equations. In each case, you will need to introduce notation to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to clearly state what your notation means.   The population of a town grows continuously at an annual rate of 1.25%.    A radioactive sample loses mass at a rate of 5.6% of its mass every day.    You have a bank account that continuously earns 4% interest every year. At the same time, you withdraw money continually from the account at the rate of $1000 per year.    A cup of hot chocolate is sitting in a 70 room. The temperature of the hot chocolate cools continuously by 10% of the difference between the hot chocolate's temperature and the room temperature every minute.    A can of cold soda is sitting in a 70 room. The temperature of the soda warms continuously at the rate of 10% of the difference between the soda's temperature and the room's temperature every minute.          Small hints for each of the prompts above.          Let be the population the time in years; .    Let be the mass the time in days; .    Let be the balance be time in years; .    Let be time in minutes the temperature of the hot chocolate; .    Let be time in minutes and the temperature of the soda; .          Let be the population of the town and let be the time in years. The population of the town grows continuously at an annual rate of means that .    Let be the mass of a radioactive sample and let be the time in days. The sample loses 5.6% f its mass every day means that .    Let be the balance (in dollars) in the account and let be the time in years. The money in the account continuously earns 4% interest every year and $1000 is withdrawn every year means that .    The temperature of a room is . Let be time in minutes. The temperature of a cup of hot chocolate cools continuosly by 10% of the difference between the hot chocolate's temperature and the room temperature every minute means that .    The temperature of a room is . Let be time in minutes. The temperature of a can of soda warms continuosly by 10% of the difference between the soda's temperature and the room temperature every minute means that .         Differential equations in the world around us  Differential equations give a natural way to describe phenomena we see in the real world. For instance, physical principles are frequently expressed as a description of how a quantity changes. A good example is Newton's Second Law, which says:    The product of an object's mass and acceleration equals the force applied to it.    For instance, when gravity acts on an object near the earth's surface, it exerts a force equal to , the mass of the object times the gravitational constant . We therefore have , where is the velocity of the object, and meters per second squared. Notice that this physical principle does not tell us what the object's velocity is, but rather how the object's velocity changes.    Shown below are two graphs depicting the velocity of falling objects. On the left is the velocity of a skydiver, while on the right is the velocity of a meteorite entering the Earth's atmosphere.    A skydiver's velocity.      A meteorite's velocity.         Begin with the skydiver's velocity and use the given graph to measure the rate of change when the velocity is , and . Plot your values on the graph below. You will want to think carefully about this: you are plotting the derivative as a function of velocity .       Now do the same thing with the meteorite's velocity: use the given graph to measure the rate of change when the velocity is , and . Plot your values on the graph above.    You should find that all your points lie on a line. Write the equation of this line being careful to use proper notation for the quantities on the horizontal and vertical axes.    The relationship you just found is a differential equation. Write a complete sentence that explains its meaning.    By looking at the differential equation, determine the values of the velocity for which the velocity increases.    By looking at the differential equation, determine the values of the velocity for which the velocity decreases.    By looking at the differential equation, determine the values of the velocity for which the velocity remains constant.          Hints for each of the prompts above.          For the skydiver:     For the meteorite: A graph of the points from parts (a) and (b) is shown in the following diagram:         .    The rate of change of velocity with respect to time is a linear function of velocity.     .     .     .       Each graph is a graph of velocity as a function of time . To estimate at a particular time, we must estimate the slope of the tangent line for the graph of at that point. For parts (a) and (b), we draw tangent lines and measure the slopes of the tangent lines. These values are approximations.   For the skydiver:     For the meteorite: A graph of the points from parts (a) and (b) is shown in the following diagram:        Using the values in parts (a) and (b), we obtain .    This differential equation means that the rate of change of velocity with respect to time is a linear function of velocity.    The velocity increases when . So the velocity increases when .    The velocity decreases when . So the velocity decreases when .    The velocity will remain constant when , which is when .       The point of this activity is to demonstrate how differential equations model processes in the real world. In this example, two factors influence the velocities: gravity and wind resistance. The differential equation describes how these factors influence the rate of change of the velocities.    Solving a differential equation  differential equation solution  A differential equation describes the derivative, or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us. By a solution to a differential equation, we mean simply a function that satisfies this description.  For instance, the first differential equation we looked at is , which describes an unknown function . We may check that is a solution because it satisfies this description. Notice that is also a solution.  If we have a candidate for a solution, it is straightforward to check whether it is a solution or not. Before we demonstrate, however, let's consider the same issue in a simpler context. Suppose we are given the equation and asked whether is a solution. To answer this question, we could rewrite the variable in the equation with the symbol : .  To determine whether is a solution, we can investigate the value of each side of the equation separately when the value is placed in and see if indeed the two resulting values are equal. Doing so, we observe that , and .  Therefore, is indeed a solution.  We will do the same thing with differential equations. Consider the differential equation .  Let's ask whether is a solution At this time, don't worry about why we chose this function; we will learn techniques for finding solutions to differential equations soon enough. . Using this formula for , observe first that and .  Since and agree for all values of when , we have indeed found a solution to the differential equation.    Consider the differential equation .  Which of the following functions are solutions of this differential equation?    .     .     .     where is any constant.          hints for each of the prompts above.           is not a solution to the given DE.     is a solution to the given DE.     is a solution to the given DE.     is a solution to the given DE for any choice of .          Since , . We observe that for this choice of , , and thus is not a solution to the given differential equation.    Since , . Hence, for this choice of , . Therefore is a solution to the given differential equation.    Since , . Hence, for this choice of , . Therefore is a solution to the given differential equation.    Since (where is a constant), . Hence, for this choice of , . Therefore is a solution to the given differential equation for any choice of .       This activity shows us something interesting. Notice that the differential equation has infinitely many solutions, which are parametrized by the constant in . In Figure , we see the graphs of these solutions for a few values of , as labeled.   The family of solutions to the differential equation .    Notice that the value of is connected to the initial value of the velocity , since . In other words, while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself, this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely: we also need to know the initial velocity. For this reason, differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions, one corresponding to each initial value. We have seen this phenomenon before: given the velocity of a moving object , we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.  If we are given a differential equation and an initial value for the unknown function, we say that we have an initial value problem. For instance, is an initial value problem. In this problem, we know the value of at one time and we know how is changing. Consequently, there should be exactly one function that satisfies the initial value problem.  This demonstrates the following important general property of initial value problems.   Initial value problems that are well behaved have exactly one solution, which exists in some interval around the initial point.   We won't worry about what well behaved means it is a technical condition that will be satisfied by all the differential equations we consider.  To close this section, we note that differential equations may be classified based on certain characteristics they may possess. You may see many different types of differential equations in a later course in differential equations. For now, we would like to introduce a few terms that are used to describe differential equations.  A first-order differential equation differential equation first order is one in which only the first derivative of the function occurs. For this reason, is a first-order equation while is a second-order equation.  A differential equation is autonomous  autonomous  differential equation autonomous if the independent variable does not appear in the description of the derivative. For instance, is autonomous because the description of the derivative does not depend on time. The equation , however, is not autonomous.    Summary     A differential equation is simply an equation that describes the derivative(s) of an unknown function.    Physical principles, as well as some everyday situations, often describe how a quantity changes, which lead to differential equations.    A solution to a differential equation is a function whose derivatives satisfy the equation's description. Differential equations typically have infinitely many solutions, parametrized by the initial values.         Matching solutions with equations   Match the solutions to the differential equations. If there is more than one solution to an equation, select the answer that includes all solutions.                  or       or              , , , , , , , and . Thus, the correct answers are: : D, : C, : E, and : B      Finding constant to complete solution   Find a positive value of for which satisfies          , then , and so we need such that Thus .      Choosing solution of   Let and be positive constants.  Which of the given functions is a solution to ?                      , so that, plugging in, we have a true statement, so that the correct answer is .       Suppose that represents the temperature of a cup of coffee set out in a room, where is expressed in degrees Fahrenheit and in minutes. A physical principle known as Newton's Law of Cooling Newton's Law of Cooling tells us that .   Supposes that . What does the differential equation give us for the value of ? Explain in a complete sentence the meaning of these two facts.    Is increasing or decreasing at ?    What is the approximate temperature at ?    On the graph below, make a plot of as a function of .       For which values of does increase? For which values of does decrease?    What do you think is the temperature of the room? Explain your thinking.    Verify that is the solution to the differential equation with initial value . What happens to this solution after a long time?          ; when , the coffee's temperature is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of degrees F per minute.     decreasing at .     degrees F.         For , increases. For , decreases.    Room temperature is degrees F.    Substitute in for in the differential equation and verify the equality holds; ; as .         Since and , . The fact that tells us the coffee's temperature at time is degrees F, and tells us that at the instant (i.e. when ), the coffee's temperature is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of degrees F per minute.    At , , and since is negative, decreasing at .    Using the linear approximation along with the given information, it follows that degrees F.    We note that is a linear function of with slope and vertical intercept , so its graph is as shown below. Note particularly that .       For , , so for these -values, increases. For , , so for these -values, decreases.    In the previous question, we observed that degrees F is the critical temperature that changes the behavior of . There are several reasons to think that degrees F is room temperature: if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature ( ), its temperature will decrease to room temperature, while if the coffee is below room temperature, its temperature will increase to room temperature. Moreover, if the coffee's temperature is (which would match the room temperature), then its rate of change is and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.    Verify that is the solution to the differential equation with initial value . What happens to this solution after a long time? Assuming that , we observe that . In addition, . The two preceding equations show that when we substitute in for , and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation. Moreover, , so the function satisfies the initial condition, too. Finally, because as , it follows that as , which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound, as we expect.       Suppose that the population of a particular species is described by the function , where is expressed in millions. Suppose further that the population's rate of change is governed by the differential equation where is the function graphed below.        For which values of the population does the population increase?    For which values of the population does the population decrease?    If , how will the population change in time?    If the initial population satisfies , what will happen to the population after a very long time?    If the initial population satisfies , what will happen to the population after a very long time?    If the initial population satisfies , what will happen to the population after a very long time?    This model for a population's growth is sometimes called growth with a threshold. Explain why this is an appropriate name.          .     and .     will not change at all.    The population will decrease toward with always being positive.    The population will increase toward with always being between and .    The population will decrease toward with always being above .    There's a maximum threshold of .          increases for since for these -values.     decreases for and since for these -values.    If , , so will not change at all with time since its derivative is .    If the initial population satisfies , we expect that the population will decrease toward with always being positive. Since is always negative for , is always decreasing on this interval. The population can't drop below because at that value of , and at that value the population wouldn't change.    If the initial population satisfies , we expect that the population will increase toward with always being between and . Since is always positive for , is always increasing on this interval. The population can't increase above because at that value of , and at that value the population wouldn't change.    If the initial population satisfies , we expect that the population will decrease toward with always being above . Since is always negative for , is always decreasing on this interval. The population can't drop below because at that value of , and at that value the population wouldn't change.    It looks like there are two thresholds for the population: there's a minimum threshold of , since below that population, the population decreases to , and there's a maximum threshold of , where if we are above the minimum but below the maximum, the population works to increase toward the maximum threshold, while if the population is above the maximum, its value will fall back toward it.       In this problem, we test further what it means for a function to be a solution to a given differential equation.   Consider the differential equation . Determine whether the following functions are solutions to the given differential equation.                     When you weigh bananas in a scale at the grocery store, the height of the bananas is described by the differential equation where is the spring constant , a constant that depends on the properties of the spring in the scale. After you put the bananas in the scale, you (cleverly) observe that the height of the bananas is given by . What is the value of the spring constant?             is a solution to the DE.     is a solution to the DE.     is a not solution to the DE.        .            To see if is a solution to , we compute and separately and see if they are equal. First, using , . Next, . Thus, satisfies the DE and is indeed a solution.    For , observe that and as well, so is a solution to the DE.    If , then but as well, so , and therefore is a not solution to the DE.       In order for to be a solution to , it must make the equation true. To find , we substitute the formula for into the DE and see what is required of . We observe that for , and . To satisfy the DE , it follows that we must have . Thus, we need , and hence .       "

  "body": " Qualitative behavior of solutions to DEs     What is a slope field?    How can we use a slope field to obtain qualitative information about the solutions of a differential equation?    What are stable and unstable equilibrium solutions of an autonomous differential equation?      In earlier work, we have used the tangent line to the graph of a function at a point to approximate the values of near . The usefulness of this approximation is that we need to know very little about the function; armed with only the value and the derivative , we may find the equation of the tangent line and the approximation .  Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information about the derivative of an unknown function. Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line at this point, a differential equation gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of a solution. We will use this information about the tangent lines to create a slope field for the differential equation, which enables us to sketch solutions to initial value problems. Our aim will be to understand the solutions qualitatively. That is, we would like to understand the basic nature of solutions, such as their long-range behavior, without precisely determining the value of a solution at a particular point.   Let's consider the initial value problem .     Use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent line to the solution at . Then use the initial value to find the equation of the tangent line at . Sketch this tangent line over the interval on the axes provided in Figure .   Grid for plotting partial tangent lines.      Also shown in Figure are the tangent lines to the solution at the points , and (we will see how to find these later). Use the graph to measure the slope of each tangent line and verify that each agrees with the value specified by the differential equation.    Using these tangent lines as a guide, sketch a graph of the solution over the interval so that the lines are tangent to the graph of .    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find , the solution to this initial value problem.    Graph the solution you found in (d) on the axes provided, and compare it to the sketch you made using the tangent lines.        Slope fields  slope field   Preview Activity shows that we can sketch the solution to an initial value problem if we know an appropriate collection of tangent lines. We can use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent line at any point of interest, and hence plot such a collection.  Let's continue looking at the differential equation . If , this equation says that . Note that this value holds regardless of the value of . We will therefore sketch tangent lines for several values of and with a slope of , as shown in Figure .    Tangent lines at points with .     Adding tangent lines at points with .     Let's continue in the same way: if , the differential equation tells us that , and this holds regardless of the value of . We now sketch tangent lines for several values of and with a slope of in Figure .  Similarly, we see that when , and when , . We may therefore add to our growing collection of tangent line plots to achieve Figure .    Adding tangent lines at points with and .     A completed slope field.     In Figure , we begin to see the solutions to the differential equation emerge. For the sake of even greater clarity, we add more tangent lines to provide the more complete picture shown at right in Figure .   Figure is called a slope field  slope field for the differential equation. It allows us to sketch solutions just as we did in the preview activity. We can begin with the initial value and start sketching the solution by following the tangent line. Whenever the solution passes through a point at which a tangent line is drawn, that line is tangent to the solution. This principle leads us to the sequence of images in Figure .    A sequence of images that show how to sketch the IVP solution that satisfies .            In fact, we can draw solutions for any initial value. Figure shows solutions for several different initial values for .   Different solutions to that correspond to different initial values.     Just as we did for the equation , we can construct a slope field for any differential equation of interest. The slope field provides us with visual information about how we expect solutions to the differential equation to behave.    Consider the autonomous differential equation .     Make a plot of versus on the axes provided in Figure . Looking at the graph, for what values of does increase and for what values of does decrease?    Axes for plotting versus .     Axes for plotting the slope field for .       Next, sketch the slope field for this differential equation on the axes provided in Figure .    Use your work in (b) to sketch (on the same axes in Figure .) solutions that satisfy , , and .    Verify that is a solution to the given differential equation with the initial value .

When , is a decreasing function of .                     and In addition, .    A constant function.          The graph below is a plot of versus . We see that when , and hence is an increasing function of . We also see that when , and hence is a decreasing function of .        Next, by sampling points in the plane and plotting short lines whose slope is , we create the following slope field for the differential equation .        Finally, by choosing starting points and following the direction of the slope field, we generate plots of solutions that satisfy , , , and , as shown in the following figure.        For , we see that and In addition, . So is a solution of the differential equation with . The graph of this function is identical to the top graph in part (c).    The solution where is a constant function.         Equilibrium solutions and stability  As our work in Activity demonstrates, first-order autonomous equations may have solutions that are constant. These are simple to detect by inspecting the differential equation : constant solutions necessarily have a zero derivative, so .  For example, in Activity , we considered the equation . Constant solutions are found by setting , which we immediately see implies that .  Values of for which in an autonomous differential equation are called equilibrium solutions  equilibrium solution of the differential equation.    Consider the autonomous differential equation .     Make a plot of versus on the axes provided in Figure . Looking at the graph, for what values of does increase and for what values of does decrease?    Axes for plotting vs for .     Axes for plotting the slope field for .       Identify any equilibrium solutions of the given differential equation.    Now sketch the slope field for the given differential equation on the axes provided in Figure .    Sketch the solutions to the given differential equation that correspond to initial values .    An equilibrium solution is called stable  stable  equilibrium solution stable if nearby solutions converge to . This means that if the initial condition varies slightly from , then . Conversely, an equilibrium solution is called unstable  unstable  equilibrium solution unstable if nearby solutions are pushed away from . Using your work above, classify the equilibrium solutions you found in (b) as either stable or unstable.    Suppose that describes the population of a species of living organisms and that the initial value is positive. What can you say about the eventual fate of this population?    Now consider a general autonomous differential equation of the form . Remember that an equilibrium solution satisfies .

The equilibrium solutions occur when and so the equilibrium solutions are and .    Following is a slope field for the differential equation .        Below is the slope field for the differential equation along with solutions that satisfy , , , , and .        The equilibrium solution is stable because trajectories nearby approach this constant solution, while the equilibrium solution is unstable because trajectories nearby veer away from this constant solution.    The population will eventually tend to 4.     Figure is for an ustable equilibrium. This is because if is slightly less than , then and the function will be decreasing. In addition, if is slightly greater than , then and the function will be increasing. In both situations, is moving away from  . Figure is for a stable equilibrium. This is because if is slightly less than , then and the function will be increasing. In addition, if is slightly greater than , then and the function will be decreasing. In both situations, is moving toward  .         Summary     A slope field is a plot created by graphing the tangent lines of many different solutions to a differential equation.    Once we have a slope field, we may sketch the graph of solutions by drawing a curve that is always tangent to the lines in the slope field.    Autonomous differential equations sometimes have constant solutions that we call equilibrium solutions. These may be classified as stable or unstable, depending on the behavior of nearby solutions.       Graphing equilibrium solutions   Consider the direction field below for a differential equation. Use the graph to find the equilibrium solutions.   Answer (separate by commas):   Note:  You can click on the graph to enlarge the image.            Sketching solution curves   Consider the two slope fields shown, in figures 1 and 2 below.        figure 1  figure 2    On a print-out of these slope fields, sketch for each three solution curves to the differential equations that generated them. Then complete the following statements:  For the slope field in figure 1, a solution passing through the point (4,-3) has a   positive    negative    zero    undefined   slope.  For the slope field in figure 1, a solution passing through the point (-2,-3) has a   positive    negative    zero    undefined   slope.  For the slope field in figure 2, a solution passing through the point (2,-1) has a   positive    negative    zero    undefined   slope.  For the slope field in figure 2, a solution passing through the point (0,3) has a   positive    negative    zero    undefined   slope.                       SOLUTION  There are many possible solution curves that could be drawn.  For the slope field in figure 1, a solution passing through the point (4,-3) has a positive slope.  For the slope field in figure 1, a solution passing through the point (-2,-3) has a negative slope.  For the slope field in figure 2, a solution passing through the point (2,-1) has a positive slope.  For the slope field in figure 2, a solution passing through the point (0,3) has a negative slope.       Matching equations with direction fields   Match the following equations with their direction field. Clicking on each picture will give you an enlarged view. While you can probably solve this problem by guessing, it is useful to try to predict characteristics of the direction field and then match them to the picture.  Here are some handy characteristics to start with -- you will develop more as you practice.    Set equal to zero and look at how the derivative behaves along the -axis.    Do the same for the -axis by setting equal to    Consider the curve in the plane defined by setting -- this should correspond to the points in the picture where the slope is zero.    Setting equal to a constant other than zero gives the curve of points where the slope is that constant. These are called isoclines, and can be used to construct the direction field picture by hand.                  Error: PGbasicmacros: imageRow: Unknown displayMode: PTX.  Error: PGbasicmacros: imageRow: Unknown displayMode: PTX.         Describing equilibrium solutions   Given the differential equation .  List the constant (or equilibrium) solutions to this differential equation in increasing order and indicate whether or not these equilibria are stable, semi-stable, or unstable. (It helps to sketch the graph. )       stable    unstable    semi-stable         stable    unstable    semi-stable         stable    unstable    semi-stable         stable    unstable    semi-stable                              Consider the differential equation .      Sketch a slope field on the axes at right.    Sketch the solutions whose initial values are .    What do your sketches suggest is the solution whose initial value is ? Verify that this is indeed the solution to this initial value problem.    By considering the differential equation and the graphs you have sketched, what is the relationship between and at a point where a solution has a local minimum?                Sketch curves through appropriate points in the slope field above.     .     and are equal.         Sketching the slopes at individual points by computing at various values of , we see the following slope field.       By following the slope field so that we pass through the points , , , , we see the collection of curves in the figure above.    It looks like the solution that passes through is a straight line with slope , and thus has the formula . To verify this function is a solution, we compute both and . Doing so, we see and . Thus, is indeed a solution to the differential equation.    From both the differential equation and the graphs we have sketched, it appears that and are equal at any point where a solution has a local minimum. This is because when , , and having the derivative be zero is required for any local minimum on a differentiable function.       Consider the situation from problem 2 of Section : Suppose that the population of a particular species is described by the function , where is expressed in millions. Suppose further that the population's rate of change is governed by the differential equation where is the function graphed below.        Sketch a slope field for this differential equation. You do not have enough information to determine the actual slopes, but you should have enough information to determine where slopes are positive, negative, zero, large, or small, and hence determine the qualitative behavior of solutions.    Sketch some solutions to this differential equation when the initial population .    Identify any equilibrium solutions to the differential equation and classify them as stable or unstable.    If , what is the eventual fate of the species? if ?    Remember that we referred to this model for population growth as growth with a threshold. Explain why this characterization makes sense by considering solutions whose inital value is close to 1.              Any solution curve that starts with will decrease to as ; any curve that starts with will increase to ; any curve that starts with will decrease to .     , , and . is unstable; and are stable.    The population will stabilize either at the value or at .     is the threshold.         We first observe from the given plot of versus that when , , and . Moreover, we see that when or , and otherwise. The closer is to , , or , the closer is to . This leads us to sketch a direction field like the following.       Following the slope field plotted above, we see that any solution curve that starts with will decrease to as . Any curve that starts with will increase to . And any curve that starts with will decrease to .    The equilibrium solutions are the values of where . These are , , and . The equilibrium solution is unstable, while the solutions and are stable.    If , the population's value will tend to as ; if , the population's value will tend to . Thus, the population will stabilize either way, but either at the value or at a level that corresponds to the population going extinct.    We can view as the threshold for this population since if there aren't at least members of the population, the population cannot grow. This aligns well with the definition of the word threshold: the magnitude or intensity that must be exceeded for a certain reaction, phenomenon, result, or condition to occur or be manifested .       The population of a species of fish in a lake is where is measured in thousands of fish and is measured in months. The growth of the population is described by the differential equation .   Sketch a graph of and use it to determine the equilibrium solutions and whether they are stable or unstable. Write a complete sentence that describes the long-term behavior of the fish population.    Suppose now that the owners of the lake allow fishers to remove 1000 fish from the lake every month (remember that is measured in thousands of fish). Modify the differential equation to take this into account. Sketch the new graph of versus . Determine the new equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable.    Given the situation in part (b), give a description of the long-term behavior of the fish population.    Suppose that fishermen remove thousand fish per month. How is the differential equation modified?    What is the largest number of fish that can be removed per month without eliminating the fish population? If fish are removed at this maximum rate, what is the eventual population of fish?         A graph of against is given in blue in the figure below. The equilibrium solutions are (unstable) and (stable).        ; the equilibrium at is unstable; the equilibrium at is stable.    If , then the fish population will die out. If , then the fish population will approach thousand fish.     ; equilibrium solutions .     fish; harvesting at that rate will maintain the number of fish we start with, provided it's at least .         A graph of against is given in blue in the figure below. This graph and the differential equation show that the equilibrium solutions occur when , or when or . Since for slightly less than 0, the solutions with decrease away from the equilibrium . Also, for slightly larger than 0 means that the solutions for increase away from the equilibrium . So is an unstable equilibrium. If is slightly less than we see that , so these solutions increase toward the equilibrium . When is slightly larger than , we have and so these solutions decrease toward the equilibrium . We conclude that the equilibrium solution is stable.       Since will decrease by thousand fish every month through harvesting, the new differential equation is . A sketch of against is given in green in the figure in (a). The equilibrium solutions now occur when . This happens when . The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to this quadratic equation are . The same argument as in (a) shows that the equilibrium at is unstable and the equilibrium at is stable.    Assuming that there are fish in the lake, so that , there are two cases to consider. If , then and the fish population will die out. If , then and the fish population will increase and approach a stable equilibrium population of thousand fish. If , then and the fish population will decrease and approach a stable equilibrium population of thousand fish.    In this case the differential equation becomes . We will have equilibrium solutions when or when .    We need a positive stable equilibrium. This will will happen as long as or when . So the maximum harvest is fish. Note that is negative, so we need to start with more than fish. Since has a maximum value of , the fish will reproduce quickly enough so that harvesting fish will maintain a stable population.       Let be the number of thousands of mice that live on a farm; assume time is measured in years. This problem is based on an ecological analysis presented in a research paper by C.S. Hollings: The Components of Predation as Revealed by a Study of Small Mammal Predation of the European Pine Sawfly, Canadian Entomology  91 : 283-320.   The population of the mice grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice. Express this as a differential equation.    At some point, the farmer brings cats to the farm. The number of mice that the cats can eat in a year is thousand mice per year. Explain how this modifies the differential equation that you found in part a).    Sketch a graph of the function for a single cat and explain its features by looking, for instance, at the behavior of when is small and when is large.    Suppose that . Find the equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable. Use this to explain the long-term behavior of the mice population depending on the initial population of the mice.    Suppose that . Find the equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable. Use this to explain the long-term behavior of the mice population depending on the initial population of the mice.    What is the smallest number of cats you would need to keep the mice population from growing arbitrarily large?          .         For positive near , ; for large values of , .    The only equilibrium solution is , which is unstable.    The equilibrium solutions are (stable) and (unstable).    At least cats.         If we let be the population of the mice at year in thousands and it grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice, the governing differential equation is .    On their own, the mice add thousand mice per year to their total population. With cats present, the cats now remove thousand mice per year. By taking both the rates at which mice are added and removed from the population into account, we find the updated differential equation     For positive near , ; for large values of , . This means that a single cat can remove about thousand mice per year from the population when the mice population is large.    Letting , we are working with the differential equation . To find the equilibrium solutions, we first set . Doing so, we find that , so , or . Factoring, we see and therefore or . Since a negative equilibrium solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, the only equilibrium solution to study is . If we plot versus for , we see that is always positive, and thus the population will grow away from , making this equilibrium unstable. And this makes sense: the population of mice will grow without bound, because one cat is insufficient to keep up with a mice population growing at a rate of times its size per year.    Letting , we are working with the differential equation . Similar work as in (d) shows that the equilibrium solutions are or , and if we plot versus , we see that for , , while for , . Thus, with cats present, as long as there are initially fewer than mice, the cats will drive the mice population to . If there are more than mice initially present, the mice population will grow without bound. And if there are mice initially present, this will be an (unstable) equilibrium.    In order to keep the mice population from growing arbitrarily large, we need to bring enough cats that for certain initial mice populations, we can make . In other words, we need enough cats that there's a positive equilibrium solution. Considering the general differential equation, , we thus set and solve for . Doing so, we find that , so or . Factoring, we find that . To have a positive equilibrium solution, we require that , and therefore the farmer must bring at least cats to the farm. Even in that circumstance, whether the cats can keep the number of mice from growing without bound will depend on the initial number of mice present.       "

The population of the mice grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice. Express this as a differential equation.    At some point, the farmer brings cats to the farm. The number of mice that the cats can eat in a year is thousand mice per year. Explain how this modifies the differential equation that you found in part a).

If we let be the population of the mice at year in thousands and it grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice, the governing differential equation is .    On their own, the mice add thousand mice per year to their total population. With cats present, the cats now remove thousand mice per year. By taking both the rates at which mice are added and removed from the population into account, we find the updated differential equation     For positive near , ; for large values of , . This means that a single cat can remove about thousand mice per year from the population when the mice population is large.    Letting , we are working with the differential equation .

Letting , we are working with the differential equation . Similar work as in (d) shows that the equilibrium solutions are or , and if we plot versus , we see that for , , while for , . Thus, with cats present, as long as there are initially fewer than mice, the cats will drive the mice population to . If there are more than mice initially present, the mice population will grow without bound. And if there are mice initially present, this will be an (unstable) equilibrium.    In order to keep the mice population from growing arbitrarily large, we need to bring enough cats that for certain initial mice populations, we can make . In other words, we need enough cats that there's a positive equilibrium solution. Considering the general differential equation, , we thus set and solve for . Doing so, we find that , so or . Factoring, we find that . To have a positive equilibrium solution, we require that , and therefore the farmer must bring at least cats to the farm.

In particular, the slope field is a plot of a large collection of tangent lines to a large number of solutions of the differential equation, and we sketch a single solution by simply following these tangent lines. With a little more thought, we can use this same idea to approximate numerically the solutions of a differential equation.   Consider the initial value problem .

In this algorithm, we will approximate the solution by taking horizontal steps of a fixed size that we denote by .    Before explaining the algorithm in detail, let's remember how we compute the slope of a line: the slope is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, as shown in Figure .  In other words, . Solving for , we see that the vertical change is the product of the slope and the horizontal change, or .    The role of slope in Euler's Method.     Now, suppose that we would like to solve the initial value problem .  There is an algorithm by which we can find an algebraic formula for the solution to this initial value problem, and we can check that this solution is . But we are instead interested in generating an approximate solution by creating a sequence of points , where . For this first example, we choose .  Since we know that , we will take the initial point to be and move horizontally by to the point . Thus, . Now, the differential equation tells us that the slope of the tangent line at this point is ,   so to move along the tangent line by taking a horizontal step of size , we must also move vertically by . We then have the approximation . At this point, we have executed one step of Euler's method, as seen graphically in Figure .   One step of Euler's method.     Now we repeat this process: at , the differential equation tells us that the slope is .   If we move forward horizontally by to , we must move vertically by .

Because we need to generate a large number of points , it is convenient to organize the implementation of Euler's method in a table as shown. We begin with the given initial data.                  From here, we compute the slope of the tangent line using the formula for from the differential equation, and then we find , the change in , using the rule .

If we apply Euler's method to approximate the solution with , the value of for every value of since is an equilibrium solution and the slope of the tangent line will always be .         The error in Euler's method  Euler's Method error  Since we are approximating the solutions to an initial value problem using tangent lines, we should expect that the error in the approximation will be smaller when the step size is smaller. Consider the initial value problem , whose solution we can easily find.  The question posed by this initial value problem is what function do we know that is the same as its own derivative and has value 1 when ? It is not hard to see that the solution is . We now apply Euler's method to approximate using several values of . These approximations will be denoted by , and we'll use them to see how accurate Euler's Method is.  To begin, we apply Euler's method with a step size of . In that case, we find that . The error is therefore .  Repeatedly halving gives the following results, expressed in both tabular and graphical form.    Errors that correspond to different values.      Error                          A plot of the error as a function of .     Notice, both numerically and graphically, that the error is roughly halved when is halved. This example illustrates the following general principle.  If Euler's method is used to approximate the solution to an initial value problem at a point , then the error is proportional to . That is, for some constant of proportionality .    Summary     Euler's method is an algorithm for approximating the solution to an initial value problem by following the tangent lines while we take horizontal steps across the -axis.    If we wish to approximate for some fixed by taking horizontal steps of size , then the error in our approximation is proportional to .

Suppose is the balance in a bank account earning interest. Be sure that you can explain why the result of your calculation in part (a) is equivalent to compounding the interest once a year instead of continuously. Then interpret the result of your calculations in parts (b) and (c) in terms of compound interest.                  A. With one step of , we have . B. With two steps of , we have , . Note that we can simplify this some: , so that . C. With four steps of , we have, following the pattern we saw in (B), , , , and . D. In part (A), we get our approximation by making a single increment, , where is just . If we think in terms of interest, is just like getting one end of the year interest payment. Since is 0.05 times the balance , it is like getting 40 dollars. Part (B) is equivalent to computing the final amount in an account that begins with 800 dollars and earns 40 dollars twice annually. Each step is like computing the interest after 6 months. When , for example, the interest is , and we add this to 800 dollars to get the new balance. Similarly, part (C) is equivalent to the final amount in an account that has an initial balance of 800 dollars and earns 40 dollars compounded quarterly.       Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate at which an object, such as a cup of coffee, cools is proportional to the difference in the object's temperature and room temperature. If is the object's temperature and is room temperature, this law is expressed at , where is a constant of proportionality. In this problem, temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and time in minutes.   Two calculus students, Alice and Bob, enter a 70 classroom at the same time. Each has a cup of coffee that is 100 . The differential equation for Alice has a constant of proportionality , while the constant of proportionality for Bob is . What is the initial rate of change for Alice's coffee? What is the initial rate of change for Bob's coffee?    What feature of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee could explain this difference?    As the heating unit turns on and off in the room, the temperature in the room is . Implement Euler's method with a step size of to approximate the temperature of Alice's coffee over the time interval . This will most easily be performed using a spreadsheet such as Excel . Graph the temperature of her coffee and room temperature over this interval.    In the same way, implement Euler's method to approximate the temperature of Bob's coffee over the same time interval. Graph the temperature of his coffee and room temperature over the interval.    Explain the similarities and differences that you see in the behavior of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee.         Alice's coffee: degrees per minute; Bob's coffee: degrees per minute.    Consider the insulation of the containers.    Alice's coffee: , with the inital condition .                                                                                                                Compare the rate of initial decrease and amplitude of oscillation.         The differential equation for Alice's coffee is , so at the instant , , and thus degrees per minute. For Bob's coffee, , so degrees per minute. These are the initial rates of change of the respective cups of coffee.    The difference between the cups of coffee could be explained by how insulated the containers are: Bob's coffee loses temperature less quickly, so his is likely better insulated.    With this varying temperature, the governing differential equation for Alice's coffee is , with the inital condition . Implementing Euler's Method with , we get the following (abbreviated) table of data.                                                       Plotting the data points that result from Euler's Method along with the room temperature function, we see how the room temperature drives the temperature of the coffee up and down as time goes on, as pictured in the figure above, where the data points for the coffee's approximate temperature are shown in dark blue, while the room temperature function, is shown in green.    Similar work with the differential equation for Bob's coffee yields the following abbreviated table of approximate function values along with the plot of the data and the temperature function.                                                         The behaviors of both cups of coffee are similar in that each decreases toward the room temperature initially and then is driven in an osciallating way by the room temperature function as it rises and falls. We see that Alice's coffee is more susceptible to being influenced away from the average room temperature, which is consistent with her mug being less well insulated, while in Bob's coffee, we see much less radical oscillations (and a slower overall rate of decrease to get near room temperature), which is consistent with being better insulated.       We have seen that the error in approximating the solution to an initial value problem is proportional to . That is, if is the Euler's method approximation to the solution to an initial value problem at , then for some constant of proportionality .  In this problem, we will see how to use this fact to improve our estimates, using an idea called accelerated convergence .   We will create a new approximation by assuming the error is exactly proportional to , according to the formula . Using our earlier results from the initial value problem and with and , we have . This is a system of two linear equations in the unknowns and . Solve this system to find a new approximation for . (You may remember that the exact value is .)    Use the other data, and to do similar work as in (a) to obtain another approximation. Which gives the better approximation? Why do you think this is?    Let's now study the initial value problem . Approximate by applying Euler's method to find approximations and . Now use the idea of accelerated convergence to obtain a better approximation. (For the sake of comparison, you want to note that the actual value is .)          ; .     ; .     and .         To solve the linear system we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate . Doing so, we find that so that and thus . Substituting this value into the first equation in the system, it follows that so .    Recalling that and , it follows that this data generates the similar linear system given by . Solving this system yields and . Knowing that the true value of is , we see that the approximation here in (b) is much better. That is expected because we are already working with better approximations that come from using and , which have been twice halved from the smaller value in (a).    To compute and , we first compute the estimates to using and . Doing so and making similar assumptions about the error as we did in (a) and (b), we find that for , and for , , and therefore we consider the system . Solving the system, it follows that and , which is much closer to the actual value of .       In this problem, we'll modify Euler's method to obtain better approximations to solutions of initial value problems. This method is called the Improved Euler's method.   In Euler's method, we walk across an interval of width using the slope obtained from the differential equation at the left endpoint of the interval. Of course, the slope of the solution will most likely change over this interval. We can improve our approximation by trying to incorporate the change in the slope over the interval.  Let's again consider the initial value problem and , which we will approximate using steps of width . Our first interval is therefore . At , the differential equation tells us that the slope is 1, and the approximation we obtain from Euler's method is that .  This gives us some idea for how the slope has changed over the interval . We know the slope at is 1, while the slope at is 1.2, trusting in the Euler's method approximation. We will therefore refine our estimate of the initial slope to be the average of these two slopes; that is, we will estimate the slope to be . This gives the new approximation .  The first few steps look like what is found in Table .   The first several steps of the improved Euler's method      Slope at  Average slope                                Continue with this method to obtain an approximation for .    Repeat this method with to obtain a better approximation for .    We saw that the error in Euler's method is proportional to . Using your results from parts (a) and (b), what power of appears to be proportional to the error in the Improved Euler's Method?          .     .    The square of .         Continuing with this method, we find , , and , which is an approximation for .    Updating this method with , we find , , , , which is an even better approximation for .    We have halved the value of in these two approximations of in the Improved Euler Method. Using the notation and for the estimates generated by the method with the respective -values, we see that the following occurs with the error (using the known value of : Computing , we find , and thus . Experimenting with powers of , it appears that these errors are each approximately , and thus the error in the Improved Euler Method seems to be proportional to the square of .       "

  "body": " Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate at which an object, such as a cup of coffee, cools is proportional to the difference in the object's temperature and room temperature. If is the object's temperature and is room temperature, this law is expressed at , where is a constant of proportionality. In this problem, temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and time in minutes.   Two calculus students, Alice and Bob, enter a 70 classroom at the same time. Each has a cup of coffee that is 100 . The differential equation for Alice has a constant of proportionality , while the constant of proportionality for Bob is . What is the initial rate of change for Alice's coffee? What is the initial rate of change for Bob's coffee?    What feature of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee could explain this difference?    As the heating unit turns on and off in the room, the temperature in the room is . Implement Euler's method with a step size of to approximate the temperature of Alice's coffee over the time interval . This will most easily be performed using a spreadsheet such as Excel . Graph the temperature of her coffee and room temperature over this interval.    In the same way, implement Euler's method to approximate the temperature of Bob's coffee over the same time interval. Graph the temperature of his coffee and room temperature over the interval.    Explain the similarities and differences that you see in the behavior of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee.         Alice's coffee: degrees per minute; Bob's coffee: degrees per minute.    Consider the insulation of the containers.    Alice's coffee: , with the inital condition .                                                                                                                Compare the rate of initial decrease and amplitude of oscillation.         The differential equation for Alice's coffee is , so at the instant , , and thus degrees per minute. For Bob's coffee, , so degrees per minute. These are the initial rates of change of the respective cups of coffee.    The difference between the cups of coffee could be explained by how insulated the containers are: Bob's coffee loses temperature less quickly, so his is likely better insulated.    With this varying temperature, the governing differential equation for Alice's coffee is , with the inital condition . Implementing Euler's Method with , we get the following (abbreviated) table of data.                                                       Plotting the data points that result from Euler's Method along with the room temperature function, we see how the room temperature drives the temperature of the coffee up and down as time goes on, as pictured in the figure above, where the data points for the coffee's approximate temperature are shown in dark blue, while the room temperature function, is shown in green.    Similar work with the differential equation for Bob's coffee yields the following abbreviated table of approximate function values along with the plot of the data and the temperature function.                                                         The behaviors of both cups of coffee are similar in that each decreases toward the room temperature initially and then is driven in an osciallating way by the room temperature function as it rises and falls. We see that Alice's coffee is more susceptible to being influenced away from the average room temperature, which is consistent with her mug being less well insulated, while in Bob's coffee, we see much less radical oscillations (and a slower overall rate of decrease to get near room temperature), which is consistent with being better insulated.

  "body": " Separable differential equations     What is a separable differential equation?    How can we find solutions to a separable differential equation?    Are some of the differential equations that arise in applications separable?      In Sections and , we have seen several ways to approximate the solution to an initial value problem. Given the frequency with which differential equations arise in the world around us, we would like to have some techniques for finding explicit algebraic solutions of certain initial value problems. In this section, we focus on a particular class of differential equations (called separable ) and develop a method for finding algebraic formulas for their solutions.  A separable differential equation  separable is a differential equation whose algebraic structure allows the variables to be separated in a particular way. For instance, consider the equation .  We would like to separate the variables and so that all occurrences of appear on the right-hand side, and all occurrences of appear on the left, multiplied by . For this example, we divide both sides by so that .  Note that when we attempt to separate the variables in a differential equation, we require that one side is a product in which the derivative is one factor and the other factor is solely an expression involving .  Not every differential equation is separable. For example, if we consider the equation , it may seem natural to separate it by writing .  As we will see, this will not be helpful, since the left-hand side is not a product of a function of with .   In this preview activity, we explore whether certain differential equations are separable or not, and then revisit some key ideas from earlier work in integral calculus.     Which of the following differential equations are separable? If the equation is separable, write the equation in the revised form .      .     .     .     .       Explain why any autonomous differential equation is guaranteed to be separable.    Why do we include the term in the expression     Suppose we know that a certain function satisfies the equation . What can you conclude about ?        Solving separable differential equations  separable  Before we discuss a general approach to solving a separable differential equation, it is instructive to consider an example.    Find all functions that are solutions to the differential equation .    We begin by separating the variables and writing .  Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable shows that .  Next, we notice that the left-hand side allows us to change the variable of antidifferentiation This is why we required that the left-hand side be written as a product in which is one of the terms. from to . In particular, , so we now have .  This equation says that two families of antiderivatives are equal to each other. Therefore, when we find representative antiderivatives of both sides, we know they must differ by an arbitrary constant . Antidifferentiating and including the integration constant on the right, we find that .  It is not necessary to include an arbitrary constant on both sides of the equation; we know that and are in the same family of antiderivatives and must therefore differ by a single constant.  Finally, we solve the last equation above for as a function of , which gives .  Of course, the term on the right-hand side represents 3 times an unknown constant. It is, therefore, still an unknown constant, which we will rewrite as . We thus conclude that the funtion is a solution to the original differential equation for any value of .  Notice that because this solution depends on the arbitrary constant , we have found an infinite family of solutions. This makes sense because we expect to find a unique solution that corresponds to any given initial value.  For example, if we want to solve the initial value problem , we know that the solution has the form for some constant . We therefore must find the appropriate value for that gives the initial value . Hence, , which shows that . The solution to the initial value problem is then .    The strategy of Example may be applied to any differential equation of the form , and any differential equation of this form is said to be separable . We work to solve a separable differential equation by writing , and then integrating both sides with respect to . After integrating, we try to solve algebraically for in order to write as a function of .    Solve the differential equation .    Following the same strategy as in Example , we have .  Integrating both sides with respect to , , and thus .  Antidifferentiating and including the integration constant, we find that .  Finally, we need to solve for . Here, one point deserves careful attention. By the definition of the natural logarithm function, it follows that .  Since is an unknown constant, is as well, though we do know that it is positive (because is positive for any ). When we remove the absolute value in order to solve for , however, this constant may be either positive or negative. To account for a possible or , we denote this updated constant by to obtain .    There is one more technical point to make. Notice that is an equilibrium solution to this differential equation. In solving the equation above, we begin by dividing both sides by , which is not allowed if . To be perfectly careful, therefore, we should consider the equilibrium solutions separately. In this case, notice that the final form of our solution captures the equilibrium solution by allowing .    Suppose that the population of a town is growing continuously at an annual rate of 3% per year.   Let be the population of the town in year . Write a differential equation that describes the annual growth rate.    Find the solutions of this differential equation.    If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000, find the population .    How long does it take for the population to double? This time is called the doubling time .    Working more generally, find the doubling time if the annual growth rate is times the population.          Small hints for each of the prompts above.                .     .    The doubling time is years.    The doubling time is .          Since the population of the town is growing at an annual rate of per year, this means that     We use separation of variables and write . We then have and thus . Evaluating the integrals on each side, we have By definition of the logarithm function, it follows that . Incorporating the that follows from the abslute value sign into the constant , we conclude that .    Given that , we see that . So .    The population will have doubled when . To determine the time it takes the population to double, we solve the equation . Thus , so . It will take about 23.1 years for the population to double in size.    If the annual growth rate is , then the differential equation for the population is . We can use separation of variables to show that , where is the population at time . We then find the doubling time by solving the equation . We first solve for and get . Taking natural logs, , and dividing by , . The doubling time for the population is thus .         Suppose that a cup of coffee is initially at a temperature of F and is placed in a F room. If is the temperature of the coffee in degrees Fahrenheit at time in minutes, Newton's law of cooling says that , where is a constant of proportionality.   Suppose you measure that the coffee is cooling at one degree per minute at the time the coffee is brought into the room. Use the differential equation to determine the value of the constant .    Find all the solutions of this differential equation.    What happens to all the solutions as ? Explain how this agrees with your intuition.    What is the temperature of the cup of coffee after 20 minutes?    How long does it take for the coffee to cool to ?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.                    The temperature of the coffee tends to 75 degrees.     F.     minutes.       We have , where is a constant. We also have .   Since the coffee is cooling at a rate of one degree per minute at time , it follows that at this instant. From the given differential equation, we know . Next, , so , and thus .    We use separation of variables to solve the differential equation . Separating variables and integrating both sides with respect to , Integrating both sides, Using the definition of the logarithm function and writing , we see that Finally, including the absolute value in and solving for , , so .    As , . So . This means that as , , or the temperature of the coffee tends to 75 degrees.    In order to determine the temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes, we need to first determine the value of the constant in the solution . To do this, we use the fact that the temperature of the coffee at is F. Thus, , so . Now we know that , and when , . The temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes is approximately F.    To determine how long it will take the coffee to cool to F, we solve the equation for . Solving first for , we subtract from both sides and divide by to get . Taking logarithms and solving for , , and thus . We conclude that it will take about 53.75 minutes for the coffee to cool to F.

It follows that , so in the usual way we can write , and therefore . Using to solve the IVP, we obtain and so . The solution to the initial value problem is .    For the initial value problem , , we first separate variables and write . Next, integrating with respect to , , and thus . Solving for , it follows . We now use the initial value and obtain . Solving for gives . The solution of the initial value problem is thus .    For the IVP , , we first separate variables and write . Integrating with respect to we find . Using the substitution on the right, it follows that . By definition and properties of the logarithm, . Writing and absorbing the absolute value from the left side, we have . Using the initial condition , we obtain or . Thus, the solution to the initial value problem is .         Summary     A separable differential equation is one that may be rewritten with all occurrences of the dependent variable multiplying the derivative and all occurrences of the independent variable on the other side of the equation.    We may find the solutions to certain separable differential equations by separating variables, integrating with respect to , and ultimately solving the resulting algebraic equation for .    This technique allows us to solve many important differential equations that arise in the world around us. For instance, questions of growth and decay and Newton's Law of Cooling give rise to separable differential equations. Later, we will learn in Section that the important logistic differential equation is also separable.

The mass of a radioactive sample decays at a rate that is proportional to its mass.   Express this fact as a differential equation for the mass using for the constant of proportionality.    If the initial mass is , find an expression for the mass .    The half-life of the sample is the amount of time required for half of the mass to decay. Knowing that the half-life of Carbon-14 is 5730 years, find the value of for a sample of Carbon-14.    How long does it take for a sample of Carbon-14 to be reduced to one-quarter its original mass?    Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes. Upon dying, however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14. Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit. By analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the amount of Carbon-14 is only 30% of the amount in living trees. Estimate the age of the firepit. This approach is the basic idea behind radiocarbon dating.          .     .          years.     years.         A differential equation that represents the given description is .    Separating the variables to solve the differential equation yields so . Integrating and solving for , we find and thus for some constant . By absorbing the absolute value into the constant , we have . Using the initial condition , it follows that . Therefore, the mass at time is given by .    If we let years pass from time , the remaining mass of the radioactive sample will be . This allows us to find the value of by setting equal to and solving for . Doing so, we have , and thus . It follows that from which we find . Hence,     Now we want to find the time so that . Similar work to our recent efforts in (c) shows that years. This number makes sense because it takes years for half of the sample to decay, then another years for half to decay again, for a total of years for the substance to decay to one quarter of its original amount.    We want to find the time it takes for to be % of , so we need to solve . Doing so in the usual way, we find that years, so we estimate that the sample is about years old.       Consider the initial value problem    Find the solution of the initial value problem and sketch its graph.    For what values of is the solution defined?    What is the value of at the last time that the solution is defined?    By looking at the differential equation, explain why we should not expect to find solutions with the value of you noted in (c).          .     .     .     is not defined when .         Separating the variables, we find that and integrating with respect to  . Evaluating the integrals and solving for , we see that and therefore , so . Applying the initial condition , we find that (we choose the from since ), so . Hence the solution to the IVP is .    The solution to the IVP is defined for .    The last time that the solution is defined is and the corresponding value of at this point is .    Recall that the differential equation is , and the righthand expression is undefined when . Hence the solution value is technically not defined at the point we noted in (c); this is connected to there being a vertical tangent line at this point in the direction field.       Suppose that a cylindrical water tank with a hole in the bottom is filled with water. The water, of course, will leak out and the height of the water will decrease. Let denote the height of the water. A physical principle called Torricelli's Law implies that the height decreases at a rate proportional to the square root of the height.   Express this fact using as the constant of proportionality.    Suppose you have two tanks, one with and another with . What physical differences would you expect to find?    Suppose you have a tank for which the height decreases at inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of inches. Find the value of .    Solve the initial value problem for the tank in part (c), and graph the solution you determine.    How long does it take for the water to run out of the tank?    Is the solution that you found valid for all time ? If so, explain how you know this. If not, explain why not.          .    The tank with has water leaving the tank much more rapidly.     .     .     minutes.    No.         Since is proportional to the square root of the height of the water, we have .    If one tank has and the other has , the tank with will have water leaving the tank much more rapidly, which should correspond to that tank having a larger hole.    Since height decreases at inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of inches, this tells us that . Applying this information to the differential equation, and thus .    To solve the differential equation with initial condition , we first separate the variables and write . Rewriting the first fraction and integrating with respect to , we have and thus , or . Knowing that , we see that , and thus . This shows that the solution to the IVP is . A plot of this function shows it to be a concave up parabola with -intercept and a repeated zero at .    It takes minutes for the tank to empty since .    No, this solution is not valid for all time . The physical constraints of the problem tell us that the solution is only valid for since at the tank is empty.

Find the population assuming that and sketch its graph. What happens to after a very long time?    Verify that the long-term behavior of your solutions agrees with what you predicted by looking at the slope field.               is stable.     .     .    Yes.              The only equilibrium solution is , since (note: is undefined, so the differential equation is not defined for ). From the slope field pictured in (a), the equilibrium solution is stable.    To solve the IVP with and , we use separation of variables. Observe that and thus On the left, using the substitution , it follows , we can rewrite the most recent equation as . Therefore, , so , or . Next, we recall that , so and . Applying the initial condition, , so , and thus . This function's plot is shown in blue in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that as since .    Changing the initial condition to , we can use all of our preceding work in (c) up to where we established . Applying this initial condition, , so , and thus . This function's plot is shown in red in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that as since .    Our work in (c) and (d) suggests that regardless of the initial condition with , the long-term behavior of will be for it to tend to as increases without bound. This matches our initial observations based on the slope field.       "

  "body": " Modeling with differential equations     How can we use differential equations to describe phenomena in the world around us?    How can we use differential equations to better understand these phenomena?      We have seen several ways that differential equations arise in the natural world, from the growth of a population to the temperature of a cup of coffee. In this section, we look more closely at how differential equations give us a natural way to describe various phenoma. As we'll see, the key is to understand the different factors that cause a quantity to change.   Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity, a differential equation naturally arises. In the following two problems, we see two such scenarios; for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.   Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an annual rate of 3%.   If you have $10,000 in the account, at what rate is your money growing?    Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account at $1,000 per year. What is the rate of change in the amount of money in the account? What are the units on this rate of change?       Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty solution, which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon, enters the tank at 2 gallons per minute.   How much salt enters the tank each minute?    Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank. How much salt is in each gallon at this point in time?    Finally, suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 2 gallons per minute. How much salt leaves the tank each minute?    What is the total rate of change in the amount of salt in the tank?           Developing a differential equation   Preview Activity demonstrates the kind of thinking we will be doing in this section. In each of the two examples we considered, there is a quantity, such as the amount of money in the bank account or the amount of salt in the tank, that is changing due to several factors. The governing differential equation states that the total rate of change is the difference between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease.    In the Great Lakes region, rivers flowing into the lakes carry a great deal of pollution in the form of small pieces of plastic averaging 1 millimeter in diameter. In order to understand how the amount of plastic in Lake Michigan is changing, construct a model for how this type of pollution has built up in the lake.    First, some basic facts about Lake Michigan.   The volume of the lake is cubic meters.    Water flows into the lake at a rate of cubic meters per year. It flows out of the lake at the same rate.    Each cubic meter flowing into the lake contains roughly cubic meters of plastic pollution.     Let's denote the amount of pollution in the lake by , where is measured in cubic meters of plastic and in years. Our goal is to describe the rate of change of this function; so we want to develop a differential equation describing .  First, we will measure how increases due to pollution flowing into the lake. We know that cubic meters of water enters the lake every year and each cubic meter of water contains cubic meters of pollution. Therefore, pollution enters the lake at the rate of .  Second, we will measure how decreases due to pollution flowing out of the lake. If the total amount of pollution is cubic meters and the volume of Lake Michigan is cubic meters, then the concentration of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is .  Since cubic meters of water flow out each year and we assume that each cubic meter of water that flows out carries with it the plastic pollution it contains , then the plastic pollution leaves the lake at the rate of .  The total rate of change of is thus the difference between the rate at which pollution enters the lake and the rate at which pollution leaves the lake; that is, .  We have now found a differential equation that describes the rate at which the amount of pollution is changing. To understand the behavior of , we apply some of the techniques we have recently developed.  Because the differential equation is autonomous, we can sketch as a function of and then construct a slope field, as shown in Figure and Figure .    Plot of vs. for .     Plot of the slope field for .     These plots both show that is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, we should expect that the amount of pollution in Lake Michigan will stabilize near cubic meters of pollution.  Next, assuming that there is initially no pollution in the lake, we will solve the initial value problem .  Separating variables, we find that .  Integrating with respect to , we have , and thus changing variables on the left and antidifferentiating on both sides, we find that   Finally, multiplying both sides by and using the definition of the logarithm, we find that .  This is a good time to determine the constant . Since when , we have ,  so .  Using this value of in Equation and solving for , we arrive at the solution .  Superimposing the graph of on the slope field we saw in Figure , we see, as shown in Figure   We see that, as expected, the amount of plastic pollution stabilizes around cubic meters.   The solution and the slope field for the differential equation .      There are many important lessons to learn from Example . Foremost is how we can develop a differential equation by thinking about the total rate = rate in - rate out model. In addition, we note how we can bring together all of our available understanding (plotting vs. , creating a slope field, solving the differential equation) to see how the differential equation describes the behavior of a changing quantity.  We can also explore what happens when certain aspects of the problem change. For instance, let's suppose we are at a time when the plastic pollution entering Lake Michigan has stabilized at cubic meters, and that new legislation is passed to prevent this type of pollution entering the lake. So, there is no longer any inflow of plastic pollution to the lake. How does the amount of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan now change? For example, how long does it take for the amount of plastic pollution in the lake to halve?  Resetting at this time, we now have the initial value problem .  It is a straightforward and familiar exercise to find that the solution to this equation is . The time that it takes for half of the pollution to flow out of the lake is given by where . Thus, we must solve the equation , or .  It follows that   In the upcoming activities, we explore some other natural settings in which differential equations model changing quantities.    Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5% every year. Let be the amount of money in the account in year .   What is the rate of change of with respect to ?    Suppose that you are also withdrawing $10,000 per year. Write a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of .    Sketch a slope field for this differential equation, find any equilibrium solutions, and identify them as either stable or unstable. Write a sentence or two that describes the significance of the stability of the equilibrium solution.    Suppose that you initially deposit $100,000 into the account. How long does it take for you to deplete the account?    What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the account?    If your initial deposit is $300,000, how much could you withdraw every year without depleting the account?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           .     .       The only equilibrium solution is .     years.    At least $200000.    Up to $15000 every year.       Let be the amount of money in a bank account in year that grows by 5% every year.   The rate of change of with respect to is .    If $10000 is being withdrawn every year, then .    Following is a slope field for the differential equation in (b).      Equilibrium solutions occur where and so the only equilibriume solution is . This means that if you have $200000 in the account, then the amount of money in the account will remain constant at $200000.    Suppose we initially have $100000 in the account. We will solve the intitial value problem . Using separation of variables, we find that , and since , we have . To determine when the account will be depleted, we solve the equation for . Since , it follows and thus , so the account will be depleted in about 13.86 years.    You must have at least $200000 in the account to make sure the account will never be depleted.    Now suppose the intitial deposit is $300000 and we want to what amount we can withdraw every year without depleting the account. So the initial value problem is . The solution to this initial value problem is . To make sure the account is never depleted, we need to be greater than or equal to 0. Solving the inequality , we obtain . We can withdraw up to $15000 every year and the account will not be depleted.         A dose of morphine is absorbed from the bloodstream of a patient at a rate proportional to the amount in the bloodstream.   Write a differential equation for , the amount of morphine in the patient's bloodstream, using as the constant proportionality.    Assuming that the initial dose of morphine is , solve the initial value problem to find . Use the fact that the half-life for the absorption of morphine is two hours to find the constant .    Suppose that a patient is given morphine intravenously at the rate of 3 milligrams per hour. Write a differential equation that combines the intravenous administration of morphine with the body's natural absorption.    Find any equilibrium solutions and determine their stability.    Assuming that there is initially no morphine in the patient's bloodstream, solve the initial value problem to determine . What happens to after a very long time?    To what rate should a doctor reduce the intravenous rate so that there is eventually 7 milligrams of morphine in the patient's bloodstream?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           , where is a positive constant.     .     , where is a positive constant.    The equilibrium solution is stable.     .    About 2.426 milligrams per hour.          We will use the differential equation , where is a positive constant.    With an initial condition of when , the solution for the initial value problem is . Using a half-life of 2 hours, we see that when . This gives , from which it follows that .    Noting that the rate of change of the drug in the body will be the differnce between the positive contributions of the dosage of 3 milligrams per hour and the decay of per hour, it follows that , where is a positive constant.    To find the equilibrium solutions, we solve the equation for . This gives . The graph of as a function of is a straight line with a negative slope. (The slope is .) So when , and the is an increasing function of . When , and the is a decreasing function of . This means that the equilibrium solution is a stable equilibrium solution.    We use the initial condition when and solve the corresponding IVP. Separating variables, , so , and thus . Solving for in the usual way gives us , where is a constant that arises from the integration constant. Using the initial condition, we obtain , so . Hence, the solution to the initial condition problem is .    We let be the unknown intravenous rate of morphine (in milligrams per hour). Notice that if we replace with in the differential equation and obtain , the solution process is the same and the equilibriume solution is . So if we want the equilibrium solution to be , we then have , so . The intravenous rate of morphine should be 2.426 milligrams per hour.         Summary     Differential equations arise in a situation when we understand how various factors cause a quantity to change.    We may use the tools we have developed so far slope fields, Euler's methods, and our method for solving separable equations to understand a quantity described by a differential equation.

In one option presented to you, you will be paid one million dollars a year for the next 25 years. You can deposit this money in an account that will earn 5% each year.   Set up a differential equation that describes the rate of change in the amount of money in the account. Two factors cause the amount to grow first, you are depositing one millon dollars per year and second, you are earning 5% interest.    If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it, how much money will you have in the account after 25 years?    The second option presented to you is to take a lump sum of 10 million dollars, which you will deposit into a similar account. How much money will you have in that account after 25 years?    Do you prefer the first or second option? Explain your thinking.    At what time does the amount of money in the account under the first option overtake the amount of money in the account under the second option?               million dollars.     million dollars.    The first.     .         Let be the amount of money (in millions) in the account at time . We know that the rate of change of is affected by the addition of million dollars a year, plus the interest earned, which is . Thus,     If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it, that means . Solving the initial value problem, we can find how much money will be in the account after 25 years. Note that , so we have and thus . Integrating (and noting that for all , , so solving for in the standard way, and thus . Since , , and we've shown . It follows that million dollars.    For this option, we know that , , and thus by the standard solution to this IVP, from which we see that million dollars.    The first option is obviously better because it leads to more money in the long term.    The amount of money in the account under the first option overtakes the amount of money in the account under the second option when . Solving for , we find that , so , and thus .       When a skydiver jumps from a plane, gravity causes her downward velocity to increase at the rate of meters per second squared. At the same time, wind resistance causes her velocity to decrease at a rate proportional to the velocity.

Find any equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable. Your result should depend on .    Suppose that the initial velocity is zero. Find the velocity .    A typical terminal velocity for a skydiver falling face down is 54 meters per second. What is the value of for this skydiver?    How long does it take to reach 50% of the terminal velocity?               is a stable equilibrium.          .     seconds.         Let the skydiver's downward velocity at time be given by . Since gravity causes her downward velocity to increase at the rate of , there is a factor of meters per second squared in the differential equation for , while the factor of wind resistence causing the velocity to decrease contributes the negative factor . Thus, the differential equation is     To find the equilibrium solutions, we set and solve for . Doing so, , so . Moreover, we note that for , , while for , . Thus, for velocities just above the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease and for velocities just below the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease, making a stable equilibrium.    We assume that and solve the IVP with the differential equation we developed. Taking the differential equation and separating the variables, we have . Integrating with respect to , , and using a standard substitution, we have . Solving for , we have (where , or . Incorporating the absolute value into the constant in the usual way, we have for some constant that and thus . Setting , we can also determine , since then so . The solution to the IVP is therefore     If the skydiver's terminal velocity is 54 meters per second, this means that Using the solution we found in (c), we observe that since as . Thus, , so .    To find how long does it take to reach 50% of the terminal velocity, we set and solve for . We have , so , and thus , which tells us . Solving for , seconds.       During the first few years of life, the rate at which a baby gains weight is proportional to the reciprocal of its weight.   Express this fact as a differential equation.    Suppose that a baby weighs 8 pounds at birth and 9 pounds one month later. How much will he weigh at one year?    Do you think this is a realistic model for a long time?          .     ; pounds.    The model is unrealistic.         Since the baby's weight, (in pounds at month ), grows at a rate proportional to its reciprocal, we have .    Given that and , we can both solve the IVP and determine . To start, we separate variables and solve the differential equation by writing and integrating to get . It follows that and therefore (where and we take the positive square root because we know ). Applying the initial condition , we find that , so and . To find , we use the additional information that , so which implies that and thus . Thus, . At one year, according to the model the baby weighs pounds.    While the function grows without bound as increases, the model is unrealistic more because the function initially doesn't grow fast enough. For example, the model predicts that at age , pounds, and at age , pounds. A realistic model would need to grow much more quickly early in life and then level off around age .       Suppose that you have a water tank that holds 100 gallons of water. A briny solution, which contains 20 grams of salt per gallon, enters the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.  At the same time, the solution is well mixed, and water is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.   Since 3 gallons enters the tank every minute and 3 gallons leaves every minute, what can you conclude about the volume of water in the tank.    How many grams of salt enters the tank every minute?    Suppose that denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank in minute . How many grams are there in each gallon in minute ?    Since water leaves the tank at 3 gallons per minute, how many grams of salt leave the tank each minute?    Write a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of .    Identify any equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable.    Suppose that there is initially no salt in the tank. Find the amount of salt in minute .    What happens to after a very long time? Explain how you could have predicted this only knowing how much salt there is in each gallon of the briny solution that enters the tank.         The inflow and outflow are at the same rate.     grams per minute.          .     .     is a stable equilibrium solution.     .     .         The volume of solution in the tank remains constant because the inflow and outflow are at the same rate.    Salt enters the tank with the inflow, which occurs at a rate of gallons per minute at a concentration of grams per gallon. Observing that , we see that salt is entering the tank at a rate of grams per minute.    Letting denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank at time , since there are gallons of solution in the tank at any time , the concentration of salt in the tank in grams per gallon is at any time .    With water leaving the tank at gallons per minute, it follows that salt is leaving the tank at a rate of .    Taking into account the rates at which salt enters and leaves the tank as established in (b) and (d) and noting that the units on are grams per minute, we have shown that .    Setting , we find that is the only equilibrium solution. This makes sense because the inflow is carrying grams of salt per gallon and thus when the tank reaches this concentration, there will be total grams of salt. This equilibrium is stable (both intuitively and because is positive for and negative for .    Assuming that , we can solve the IVP with . For somewhat simpler computations, we write . Separating variables, and integrating with respect to , so that . Solving for in the usual way, and using the initial condition that , we find so that .    As , we know , and thus . This makes sense because the inflow carries grams of salt per liter continuously. As time goes on, the concentration of solution in the tank should tend to that same concentration, and with gallons of solution, the amount of salt will tend to grams. This value also matches the stable equilibrium that we found in (f).       "

  "body": "  In the Great Lakes region, rivers flowing into the lakes carry a great deal of pollution in the form of small pieces of plastic averaging 1 millimeter in diameter. In order to understand how the amount of plastic in Lake Michigan is changing, construct a model for how this type of pollution has built up in the lake.    First, some basic facts about Lake Michigan.   The volume of the lake is cubic meters.    Water flows into the lake at a rate of cubic meters per year. It flows out of the lake at the same rate.    Each cubic meter flowing into the lake contains roughly cubic meters of plastic pollution.     Let's denote the amount of pollution in the lake by , where is measured in cubic meters of plastic and in years. Our goal is to describe the rate of change of this function; so we want to develop a differential equation describing .  First, we will measure how increases due to pollution flowing into the lake. We know that cubic meters of water enters the lake every year and each cubic meter of water contains cubic meters of pollution. Therefore, pollution enters the lake at the rate of .  Second, we will measure how decreases due to pollution flowing out of the lake. If the total amount of pollution is cubic meters and the volume of Lake Michigan is cubic meters, then the concentration of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is .  Since cubic meters of water flow out each year and we assume that each cubic meter of water that flows out carries with it the plastic pollution it contains , then the plastic pollution leaves the lake at the rate of .  The total rate of change of is thus the difference between the rate at which pollution enters the lake and the rate at which pollution leaves the lake; that is, .  We have now found a differential equation that describes the rate at which the amount of pollution is changing. To understand the behavior of , we apply some of the techniques we have recently developed.  Because the differential equation is autonomous, we can sketch as a function of and then construct a slope field, as shown in Figure and Figure .    Plot of vs. for .     Plot of the slope field for .     These plots both show that is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, we should expect that the amount of pollution in Lake Michigan will stabilize near cubic meters of pollution.  Next, assuming that there is initially no pollution in the lake, we will solve the initial value problem .  Separating variables, we find that .  Integrating with respect to , we have , and thus changing variables on the left and antidifferentiating on both sides, we find that   Finally, multiplying both sides by and using the definition of the logarithm, we find that .  This is a good time to determine the constant . Since when , we have ,  so .  Using this value of in Equation and solving for , we arrive at the solution .  Superimposing the graph of on the slope field we saw in Figure , we see, as shown in Figure   We see that, as expected, the amount of plastic pollution stabilizes around cubic meters.

Identify any equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable.    Suppose that there is initially no salt in the tank. Find the amount of salt in minute .    What happens to after a very long time? Explain how you could have predicted this only knowing how much salt there is in each gallon of the briny solution that enters the tank.         The inflow and outflow are at the same rate.     grams per minute.          .     .     is a stable equilibrium solution.     .     .         The volume of solution in the tank remains constant because the inflow and outflow are at the same rate.    Salt enters the tank with the inflow, which occurs at a rate of gallons per minute at a concentration of grams per gallon. Observing that , we see that salt is entering the tank at a rate of grams per minute.    Letting denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank at time , since there are gallons of solution in the tank at any time , the concentration of salt in the tank in grams per gallon is at any time .    With water leaving the tank at gallons per minute, it follows that salt is leaving the tank at a rate of .    Taking into account the rates at which salt enters and leaves the tank as established in (b) and (d) and noting that the units on are grams per minute, we have shown that .    Setting , we find that is the only equilibrium solution. This makes sense because the inflow is carrying grams of salt per gallon and thus when the tank reaches this concentration, there will be total grams of salt. This equilibrium is stable (both intuitively and because is positive for and negative for .    Assuming that , we can solve the IVP with . For somewhat simpler computations, we write . Separating variables, and integrating with respect to , so that . Solving for in the usual way, and using the initial condition that , we find so that .    As , we know , and thus . This makes sense because the inflow carries grams of salt per liter continuously. As time goes on, the concentration of solution in the tank should tend to that same concentration, and with gallons of solution, the amount of salt will tend to grams. This value also matches the stable equilibrium that we found in (f).     "

  "body": " Population Growth and the Logistic Equation     How can we use differential equations to realistically model the growth of a population?    How can we assess the accuracy of our models?      The growth of the earth's population is one of the pressing issues of our time. Will the population continue to grow? Or will it perhaps level off at some point, and if so, when? In this section, we look at two ways in which we may use differential equations to help us address these questions.  Before we begin, let's consider again two important differential equations that we have seen in earlier work this chapter.   Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size.   We begin with the differential equation . Sketch a slope field below as well as a few typical solutions on the axes provided.       Find all equilibrium solutions of the equation and classify them as stable or unstable.    If is positive, describe the long-term behavior of the solution to .    Let's now consider a modified differential equation given by . As before, sketch a slope field as well as a few typical solutions on the following axes provided.       Find any equilibrium solutions and classify them as stable or unstable.    If is positive, describe the long-term behavior of the solution.        The earth's population  We will now begin studying the earth's population. To get started, in Table are some data for the earth's population in recent years that we will use in our investigations.   Some recent population data for planet Earth.    Year  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010     Pop  (billions)                  Our first model will be based on the following assumption:    The rate of change of the population is proportional to the population.    On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable. When there is a relatively small number of people, there will be fewer births and deaths so the rate of change will be small. When there is a larger number of people, there will be more births and deaths so we expect a larger rate of change.  If is the population years after the year 2000, we may express this assumption as where is a constant of proportionality.   Use the data in the table to estimate the derivative using a central difference. Assume that corresponds to the year 2000.    What is the population ?    Use your results from (a) and (b) to estimate the constant of proportionality in the differential equation.    Now that we know the value of , we have the initial value problem . Find the solution to this initial value problem.    What does your solution predict for the population in the year 2010? Is this close to the actual population given in the table?    When does your solution predict that the population will reach 12 billion?    What does your solution predict for the population in the year 2500?    Do you think this is a reasonable model for the earth's population? Why or why not? Explain your thinking using a couple of complete sentences.          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           .     .     .     .     .     , or in the year 2056.     billion.       We let be the population after year 2000 with , where is a constant of proportionality.   Using the data in the table, .    Since corresponds to the year , .    Using and the preceding values at , we have , so .    The solution for the initial value problem is .    The year 2010 corresponds to . So . The model predicts that the population in 2010 will be about 6.888 billion.    The population will be 12 billion when . So we solve the equation for . We see that , so . The population will reach 12 billion during the year 2056.    The year 2500 corresponds to . So . The model predicts that the population in 2500 will be about 3012 billion or about about 3 012 300 000 000. This is rather unreasonably large.       Our work in Activity shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years relatively close to 2000. However, if we go too far into the future, the model predicts increasingly large rates of change, which causes the population to grow arbitrarily large. This does not make much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support such a large population.  The constant in the differential equation has an important interpretation. Let's rewrite the differential equation by solving for , so that we have .  We see that is the ratio of the rate of change to the population; in other words, it is the contribution to the rate of change from a single person. We call this the per capita growth rate . per capita growth rate   In the exponential model we introduced in Activity , the per capita growth rate is constant. This means that when the population is large, the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population is small. It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should decrease when the population becomes large, since there will not be enough resources to support so many people. We expect it would be a more realistic model to assume that the per capita growth rate depends on the population .  In the previous activity, we computed the per capita growth rate in a single year by computing , the quotient of and (which we did for ). If we return to the data in Table and compute the per capita growth rate over a range of years, we generate the data shown in Figure , which shows how the per capita growth rate is a function of the population, .   A plot of per capita growth rate vs. population .    From the data, we see that the per capita growth rate appears to decrease as the population increases. In fact, the points seem to lie very close to a line, which is shown at two different scales in Figure .   The line that approximates per capita growth as a function of population, .       Looking at this line carefully, we can find its equation to be .  If we multiply both sides by , we arrive at the differential equation .  Graphing the dependence of on the population , we see that this differential equation demonstrates a quadratic relationship between and , as shown in Figure .   A plot of vs. for the differential equation .    The equation is an example of the logistic equation , and is the second model for population growth that we will consider. We expect that it will be more realistic, because the per capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the population.  Indeed, the graph in Figure shows that there are two equilibrium solutions, , which is unstable, and , which is a stable equilibrium. The graph shows that any solution with will eventually stabilize around 12.5. Thus, our model predicts the world's population will eventually stabilize around 12.5 billion.  A prediction for the long-term behavior of the population is a valuable conclusion to draw from our differential equation. We would, however, also like to answer some quantitative questions. For instance, how long will it take to reach a population of 10 billion? To answer this question, we need to find an explicit solution of the equation.    Solving the logistic differential equation  logistic  Since we would like to apply the logistic model in more general situations, we state the logistic equation logistic equation in its more general form, .  The equilibrium solutions here are and , which shows that . The equilibrium at is called the carrying capacity  carrying capacity of the population for it represents the stable population that can be sustained by the environment.  We now solve the logistic equation . The equation is separable, so we separate the variables , and integrate to find that .  To find the antiderivative on the left, we use the partial fraction decomposition .  Now we are ready to integrate, with .  On the left, observe that is constant, so we can remove a factor of and antidifferentiate to find that .  Multiplying both sides of this last equation by and using a rule of logarithms, we next find that .  From the definition of the logarithm, replacing with , and letting absorb the absolute value signs, we now know that .  At this point, all that remains is to determine and solve algebraically for .  If the initial population is , then it follows that , so .  We will solve this equation for by multiplying both sides by to obtain .  Solving for , expanding, and factoring, it follows that .  Dividing to solve for , we see that .  Finally, we choose to multiply the numerator and denominator by to obtain .  While that was a lot of algebra, notice the result: we have found an explicit solution to the logistic equation.   Solution to the Logistic Equation  The solution to the initial value problem , logistic equation solution is .   For the logistic equation describing the earth's population that we worked with earlier in this section, we have .  This gives the solution , whose graph is shown in Figure .   The solution to the logistic equation modeling the earth's population.    The graph shows the population leveling off at 12.5 billion, as we expected, and that the population will be around 10 billion in the year 2050. These results, which we have found using a relatively simple mathematical model, agree fairly well with predictions made using a much more sophisticated model developed by the United Nations.  The logistic equation is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible. For instance, it could model the spread of a flu virus through a population contained on a cruise ship, the rate at which a rumor spreads within a small town, or the behavior of an animal population on an island. Through our work in this section, we have completely solved the logistic equation, regardless of the values of the constants , , and . Anytime we encounter a logistic equation, we can apply the formula we found in Equation .    Consider the logistic equation with the graph of vs. shown in Figure .   Plot of vs. .       At what value of is the rate of change greatest?    Consider the model for the earth's population that we created. At what value of is the rate of change greatest? How does that compare to the population in recent years?    According to the model we developed, what will the population be in the year 2100?    According to the model we developed, when will the population reach 9 billion?    Now consider the general solution to the general logistic initial value problem that we found, given by . Verify algebraically that and that .          Small hints for each of the prompts above.          When .    When the population is 6.125 billion.     ; billion.     (so in about year ).     .       Consider the logistic equation .   The maximum value for will occur when since this is the highest point on the graph.    The model we created for the population of the earth was , which can be rewritten as . So for this model, the maximum rate of change for the earth's population will occur when the population is 6.125 billion. This value is slightly less than the earth's population in recent years.    So for the logistic model, we have , . Using the year 2000 as , the initial population is 6.084. So the solution for the differential equation in part (b) is . For the year 2100, we use and this model predicts that in the year 2100, the earth's population will be 11.504 billion.    To determine when this model predicts that the earth's population will be 9 billion, we solve the equation for . Multiplying both sides by , we have . Dividing by then subtracting from both sides, . Thus, . Using logarithms in the usual way, . The earth's population will reach 9 billion in about 2040.    The solution for the general logistic initial value problem is . For this solution, we see that To determine , we first note that since , . Hence, , and therefore, .         Summary     If we assume that the rate of growth of a population is proportional to the population, we are led to a model in which the population grows without bound and at a rate that grows without bound.    By assuming that the per capita growth rate decreases as the population grows, we are led to the logistic model of population growth, which predicts that the population will eventually stabilize at the carrying capacity.       Analyzing a logistic equation   The slope field for a population modeled by is shown in the figure below.   (a) On a print-out of the slope field, sketch three non-zero solution curves showing different types of behavior for the population . Give an initial condition that will produce each:   ,   , and   .  (b) Is there a stable value of the population? If so, give the value; if not, enter none :  Stable value =  (c) Considering the shape of solutions for the population, give any intervals for which the following are true. If no such interval exists, enter none , and if there are multiple intervals, give them as a list. (Thus, if solutions are increasing when is between 1 and 3, enter (1,3) for that answer; if they are decreasing when is between 1 and 2 or between 3 and 4, enter (1,2),(3,4). Note that your answers may reflect the fact that is a population.)  is increasing when is in  is decreasing when is in  Think about what these conditions mean for the population, and be sure that you are able to explain that.  In the long-run, what is the most likely outcome for the population?    (Enter infinity if the population grows without bound.)  Are there any inflection points in the solutions for the population? If so, give them as a comma-separated list (e.g., 1,3); if not, enter none .  Inflection points are at   Be sure you can explain what the meaning of the inflection points is for the population.  (d) Sketch a graph of against . Use your graph to answer the following questions.  When is positive?  When is in  When is negative?  When is in  (Give your answers as intervals or a list of intervals.)  When is zero?  When   (If there is more than one answer, give a list of answers, e.g., 1,2 .)  When is at a maximum?  When   Be sure that you can see how the shape of your graph of explains the shape of solution curves to the differential equation.                                                               Thus we get different solution behaviors for the initial conditions , , and . The initial condition gives the zero solution, which is an equilibrium and has the same behavior as the initial condition . Note that we can also say that the behavior for initial conditions is different from that for initial conditions , because the former will be sigmoidal while the latter are strictly exponential. From the solutions graphed above, or by looking at the slope field, we can see that the equilibrium solution is stable. The other equilibrium solution, is unstable. Also by looking at the solution curves, we can see that is increasing when and decreasing when . In the long run, we're most likely to start with a non-zero population and thus . The solution curves with initial populations of less than have inflection points at . (This will be demonstrated algebraically below.) At the inflection point, the population is growing fastest. A graph of against is shown below. Since , the graph of against is a parabola, opening downward with intercepts at 0 and 0.5. The quantity is positive for , negative for (and ). The quantity is 0 at and , and maximum at . The fact that at and tells us that these are equilibria. Further, since for , we see that solution curves starting here will increase toward . If the population starts at a value , it increases at an increasing rate up to . After this, continues to increase, but at a decreasing rate. The fact that has a maximum at tells us that there is a point of inflection when . Similarly, since for , solution curves starting with will decrease to . Thus, is a stable equilibrium.      Analyzing a logistic model   The table below gives the percentage, , of households with a VCR, as a function of year.    Year  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984    P  0.3  0.5  1.1  1.8  3.1  5.5  10.6    Year  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991    P  20.8  36.0  48.7  58.0  64.6  71.9  71.9    (a) A logistic model is a good one to use for these data. Explain why this might be the case: logically, how large would the growth in VCR ownership be when they are first introduced? How large can the ownership ever be?  We can also investigate this by estimating the growth rate of for the given data. Do this at the beginning, middle, and near the end of the data:        Be sure you can explain why this suggests that a logistic model is appropriate.  (b) Use the data to estimate the year when the point of inflection of occurs.  The inflection point occurs approximately at .  (Give the year in which it occurs.)  What percent of households had VCRs then?   What limiting value does this point of inflection predict (note that if the logistic model is reasonable, this prediction should agree with the data for 1990 and 1991)?    (c) The best logistic equation (solution to the logistic differential equation) for these data turns out to be the following.  What limiting value does this predict?                                        (a) The logistic model is a reasonable one because at first very few houses have a VCR. As movie rentals become popular and as VCRs get cheaper, more people will buy VCRs. However, we know that the rate of VCR buying will start slowing down at some point as it is impossible for more than 100 (b) To find the point of inflection, we must find the year at which the rate of VCR buying changes from increasing to decreasing. The following table shows the rate of change in the years from 1978 to 1990.   Year  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984    Change per year  0.2  0.6  0.7  1.3  2.4  5.1  10.2    Year  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991    Change per year  15.2  12.7  9.3  6.6  7.3  0    Looking at the table, we see that the rate of percent change per year changes from increasing to decreasing in the year 1986. At this time (at the inflection point) we expect the vertical coordinate to be , one-half of the limiting value for the population. Thus we have , or , which fits in well with the data that we have for 1990 and 1991. (c) Since the general form of a logistic equation is where is the limiting value, we have that in our case and the limiting value is 75.      Finding a logistic function for an infection model   The total number of people infected with a virus often grows like a logistic curve. Suppose that 25 people originally have the virus, and that in the early stages of the virus (with time, , measured in weeks), the number of people infected is increasing exponentially with . It is estimated that, in the long run, approximately 6500 people become infected.  (a) Use this information to find a logistic function to model this situation.    (b) Sketch a graph of your answer to part (a). Use your graph to estimate the length of time until the rate at which people are becoming infected starts to decrease. What is the vertical coordinate at this point?  vertical coordinate =             (a) We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function where and is the number of people infected by the virus at a particular time . We know that is the limiting value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so in our case We are also told that initially there are only 25 people infected with the virus so that we get Thus we have We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection grows exponentially with . Thus we get that the logistic function for people infected is  (b) Graphing this solution, we see Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at roughly giving a value of . Thus after roughly 3375 people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.      Analyzing a population growth model   Any population, , for which we can ignore immigration, satisfies  For organisms which need a partner for reproduction but rely on a chance encounter for meeting a mate, the birth rate is proportional to the square of the population. Thus, the population of such a type of organism satisfies a differential equation of the form This problem investigates the solutions to such an equation.  (a) Sketch a graph of against . Note when is positive and negative.  when is in  when is in  (Your answers may involve a and b. Give your answers as an interval or list of intervals: thus, if dP\/dt is less than zero for P between 1 and 3 and P greater than 4, enter (1,3),(4,infinity) .)  (b) Use this graph to sketch the shape of solution curves with various initial values: use your answers in part (a), and where is increasing and decreasing to decide what the shape of the curves has to be. Based on your solution curves, why is called the threshold population?  If , what happens to in the long run?    If , what happens to in the long run?    If , what happens to in the long run?                              (a) A graph of vs is shown below. Thus, is negative when and positive when (we ignore , because this doesn't make sense for a population). (b) We can see from the graph above that is a decreasing function when . Similarly, when , the sign of is positive, so is an increasing function. Thus solution curves starting above are increasing, and those starting below are decreasing. We can also see that for , the slope, , increases with , so the graph of against is concave up. For , the value of decreases with time. As decreases, the slope decreases for , and increases toward 0 for . Thus solution curves starting just below the threshold value of are concave down for and concave up and asymptotic to the -axis for . Thus, solution curves are similar to those shown in the graph below  is called the threshold population because for populations greater than , the population will increase without bound. For populations less than , the population will go to zero, i.e. to extinction. The value is an unstable equilibrium, and is a stable equilibrium.       The logistic equation may be used to model how a rumor spreads through a group of people. Suppose that is the fraction of people that have heard the rumor on day . The equation describes how changes. Suppose initially that one-tenth of the people have heard the rumor; that is, .   What happens to after a very long time?    Determine a formula for the function .    At what time is changing most rapidly?    How long does it take before 80% of the people have heard the rumor?          as provided .     .     days.     days.         The equilibrium solutions for this logistic equation are and . Since is the carrying capacity and thus a stable equilibrium, as provided .    We know that the general solution to the logistic equation is . In the context of this problem, we know that , , and and therefore the solution is .    We know that is changing most rapidly when its derivative, , is largest. Recalling the original differential equation, we know that which shows that is a quadratic function of . That quadratic function has zeros at and , so the vertex of this concave down quadratic function lies at , and at this value of the rate of change of is largest. Thus, we solve the equation to find the time at which the population is increasing fastest. We see that so and . It follows that days.    Since tells us the percentage of people who've heard the rumor, we need to solve the equation . Thus we have so and . It follows that days.       Suppose that measures the number of bacteria living in a colony in a Petri dish, where is measured in thousands and is measured in days. One day, you measure that there are 6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3. A few days later, you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 2.   Assume that the per capita growth rate is a linear function of . Use the measurements to find this function and write a logistic equation to describe .    What is the carrying capacity for the bacteria?    At what population is the number of bacteria increasing most rapidly?    If there are initially 1,000 bacteria, how long will it take to reach 80% of the carrying capacity?               .    When .     days.         Let be the per capita growth rate as a function of . Using the given data in the problem statement, we know that this linear function passes through the points and . The equation of this line is thus so . Since the logistic equation comes from taking the product of the population at time with its per capita growth rate at that time, we find that     From the form of the logistic equation, we see that the carrying capacity for the bacteria is , which is a stable equilibrium for the population.    The bacteria is increasing most rapidly when is greatest. Since is a quadratic function of , is maximized at the vertex of this concave down parabola, which occurs halfway between its zeros: and . Thus, when , the population is growing fastest. To find the exact -value when this occurs, we'd need to know an initial condition like in the next part of the problem.    Using , we solve the logistic equation IVP with . Using , , and , we know from the standard form of the solution to the logistic equation that . To find how long it takes the bacteria to reach 80% of the carrying capacity, we solve the equation . That equation implies that , so and thus . It follows that days.       Suppose that the population of a species of fish is controlled by the logistic equation , where is measured in thousands of fish and is measured in years.   What is the carrying capacity of this population?    Suppose that a long time has passed and that the fish population is stable at the carrying capacity. At this time, humans begin harvesting 20% of the fish every year. Modify the differential equation by adding a term to incorporate the harvesting of fish.    What is the new carrying capacity?    What will the fish population be one year after the harvesting begins?    How long will it take for the population to be within 10% of the carrying capacity?         10000 fish.     .     fish.     thousand fish.     years.         From the form of the given logistic equation, we can see the carrying capacity is 10000 fish.    In this situation, the initial condition is , and by removing % of the population per year, we subtract from the rate that defines the differential equation, thus finding .    Expanding and rewriting the differential equation in (b), we see that . This, too, is a logistic equation, with carrying capacity fish.    We can solve this logistic equation in the usual way (keeping in mind the initial condition , and noting that the carrying capacity is ): After one year, the population of fish will thus be thousand fish.    To be within 10% of the carrying capacity, we need . Since the initial condition is larger than the carrying capacity, we want to know when . Thus we solve the equation , which implies . Thus, , so years.       "

What limiting value does this point of inflection predict (note that if the logistic model is reasonable, this prediction should agree with the data for 1990 and 1991)?

What limiting value does this predict?                                        (a) The logistic model is a reasonable one because at first very few houses have a VCR. As movie rentals become popular and as VCRs get cheaper, more people will buy VCRs. However, we know that the rate of VCR buying will start slowing down at some point as it is impossible for more than 100 (b) To find the point of inflection, we must find the year at which the rate of VCR buying changes from increasing to decreasing.

Thus we have , or , which fits in well with the data that we have for 1990 and 1991.

Based on your response to the part (b), decide if the sequence has a limit as . If so, what is the limit? If not, why not?          A function has limit as if we can make as close to as we like by .    Think about making as close as you want to for large values of .    Compare as .          A continuous function has a limit as the independent variable goes to infinity if we can make the values of as close to as we want by choosing as large as we need.    We expect that a sequence will have a limit as goes to infinity if we can make the entries in the sequence as close to as we want by choosing as large as we need.    As gets large, the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to and so looks like or 1 for large . So the sequence has a limit of 1 at infinity.       In Activities and we investigated a sequence that has a limit as goes to infinity. More formally, we make the following definition.    A sequence  converges  converge sequence or is a convergent sequence  convergent sequence provided that there is a number such that we can make as close to as we want by taking sufficiently large. In this situation, we call the limit of the convergent sequence and write . If the sequence does not converge, we say that the sequence  diverges . diverge sequence     The idea of sequence having a limit as is the same as the idea of a continuous function having a limit as . The only difference is that sequences are discrete instead of continuous.    Use graphical and\/or algebraic methods to determine whether each of the following sequences converges or diverges.              (where is the factorial symbol and for any positive integer (as convention we define to be 1)).          Multiply the numerator and denominator each by .    Compare .    Plot the sequence and think about what the graph suggests.          The sequence converges to .    The sequence diverges to infinity.     as .          A plot of the first 50 terms of the sequence is shown here.     The plot implies that the sequence has a limit between 0.5 and 1. For large the term dominates the numerator and the term the denominator. So looks like when is big. So the sequence converges to .    A plot of the first 50 terms of the sequence is shown here.     The plot implies that the sequence does not have a limit as goes to infinity. For large the term dominates the numerator and the term the denominator. So looks like when is big. Since , the sequence diverges to infinity.    A plot of the first 50 terms of the sequence is shown here.     Initially, it looks as though the terms increase without bound, but beginning at about the factorial in the denominator dominates the numerator. Notice that When , we have that and . Since , the term goes to 0 as goes to infinity. The fact that is a constant means that as .         Summary     A sequence is a list of objects in a specified order. We will typically work with sequences of real numbers. We can think of a sequence as a function from the positive integers to the set of real numbers.    A sequence of real numbers converges to a number if we can make every value of for as close as we want to by choosing sufficiently large.    A sequence diverges if it does not converge.         Limits of five sequences   Match the formulas with the descriptions of the behavior of the sequence as .                     converges to zero through positive and negative numbers    does not converge, but doesn't go to    diverges to    converges to one from above and below    converges to one from above     SOLUTION  The correct behaviors are 1 matches D, 2 matches C, 3 matches E, 4 matches A, and 5 matches B.       Formula for a sequence, given first terms   Find a formula for , for the sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, 24...          is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25,... The sequence we have is offset by 1 from this, so .

Suppose that the analog signal is given by Give the first 6 terms of a sampling of the signal every seconds:  (Enter your answer as a comma-separated list.)        , ,..., so they are , , , , , and .       Finding limits of convergent sequences can be a challenge. However, there is a useful tool we can adapt from our study of limits of continuous functions at infinity to use to find limits of sequences. We illustrate in this exercise with the example of the sequence .   Calculate the first 10 terms of this sequence. Based on these calculations, do you think the sequence converges or diverges? Why?    For this sequence, there is a corresponding continuous function defined by . Draw the graph of on the interval and then plot the entries of the sequence on the graph. What conclusion do you think we can draw about the sequence if ? Explain.    Note that has the indeterminate form as goes to infinity. What idea from differential calculus can we use to calculate ? Use this method to find . What, then, is ?         Unclear whether it converges or diverges.                                        If , then as well.     .         Decimal approximations of the first terms of this sequence are given in the following table. The numbers in this sequence originally increase, but then seem to be decreasing. It looks as though the sequence might converge, but if so it isn't clear to what value the sequence converges.                                        The graph of on the interval and the graph of the sequence for from 1 to 10 are shown in the figure below. Since the graph of the sequence follows the graph of the function , and since is a strictly decreasing function, we should expect that if , then as well.       Since we have the indeterminate form , we can apply L'Hopital's Rule to determine the limit. In this case, we have . So we should expect that .       We return to the example begun in Preview Activity to see how to derive the formula for the amount of money in an account at a given time. We do this in a general setting. Suppose you invest dollars (called the principal ) in an account paying interest compounded monthly. In the first month you will receive (here is in decimal form; e.g., if we have interest, we write ) of the principal in interest, so you earn dollars in interest. Assume that you reinvest all interest. Then at the end of the first month your account will contain the original principal plus the interest, or a total of dollars.   Given that your principal is now dollars, how much interest will you earn in the second month? If is the total amount of money in your account at the end of the second month, explain why .    Find a formula for , the total amount of money in the account at the end of the third month in terms of the original investment .    There is a pattern to these calculations. Let the total amount of money in the account at the end of the third month in terms of the original investment . Find a formula for .          in interest in the second month; at the end of the second month, .     .     is a pattern to these calculations.         The principal of dollars will earn in interest in the second month. Thus, at the end of the second month, the total amount in your account will be . Factoring and recalling that  .    The principal of dollars will earn in interest in the third month. Thus, at the end of the third month, the total amount in your account will be . Factoring and recalling that  .    Based on the pattern we observe, continuing the same line of reasoning we find that is a pattern to these calculations.       Sequences have many applications in mathematics and the sciences. In a recent paper Hui H, Farilla L, Merkel P, Perfetti R. The short half-life of glucagon-like peptide-1 in plasma does not reflect its long-lasting beneficial effects, Eur J Endocrinol 2002 Jun;146(6):863-9. the authors write   The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is capable of ameliorating glucose-dependent insulin secretion in subjects with diabetes. However, its very short half-life (1.5-5 min) in plasma represents a major limitation for its use in the clinical setting.   The half-life of GLP-1 is the time it takes for half of the hormone to decay in its medium. For this exercise, assume the half-life of GLP-1 is 5 minutes. So if is the amount of GLP-1 in plasma at some time , then only of the hormone will be present after minutes. Suppose grams of the hormone are initially present in plasma.   Let be the amount of GLP-1 present after 5 minutes. Find the value of .    Let be the amount of GLP-1 present after 10 minutes. Find the value of .    Let be the amount of GLP-1 present after 15 minutes. Find the value of .    Let be the amount of GLP-1 present after 20 minutes. Find the value of .    Let be the amount of GLP-1 present after minutes. Find a formula for .    Does the sequence converge or diverge? If the sequence converges, find its limit and explain why this value makes sense in the context of this problem.    Determine the number of minutes it takes until the amount of GLP-1 in plasma is 1 gram.          .     .     .     .     .     as time goes on.    It takes about half-lives to elapse to get down to gram remaining, or minutes.         Since one half-life has passed at , .    Since another half-life has passed at , .    Yet another half-life has passed at , so .    Continuing, .    After minutes, half-lives have elapsed, and thus we find that .    From the behavior of exponential functions, we know that if , then as . It follows that as , and therefore as time goes on. This makes sense because the human body will consume and change the drug in the body and eliminate it unless additional doses are taken.    To determine the time at which gram of the hormone remains in the body, we solve the equation . This implies that , and thus . Thus, it takes about half-lives to elapse to get down to gram remaining, or minutes.       Continuous data is the basis for analog information, like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records. A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information. For example, the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second. So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information. Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for, among other things, noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space. While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter, this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.  Let be the continuous function defined by on the interval . A graph of is shown in Figure .   The graph of on the interval    We approximate by sampling , that is by partitioning the interval into uniform subintervals and recording the values of at the endpoints.   Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal. As an example, partition the interval into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points (the sample ) using the endpoints of each subinterval. Plot your sample on graph of in Figure Figure . What can you say about the period of your sample as compared to the period of the original function?    The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As the part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called aliasing ). There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the lowest rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points. Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function and determine the number of partitions of the interval that give us the Nyquist rate.    Humans cannot typically pick up signals above 20 kHz. Explain why, then, that information on a compact disk is sampled at 44,100 Hz.         The data points do not appear periodic at all.       At least samples, so at least every seconds.     Hz is slightly more than double KHz.         Sampling the function at the endpoints of equal subintervals of length , we see the data pictured in the following figure (with the sample points in red). While the function is periodic with a period of , the data points do not appear periodic at all as none of them has repeated (yet) over the course of the pictured interval.       Since the period of the function is , its frequency is , which means that this function completes about cycles per second. Doubling this frequncy gives us a value of . This means that we should sample the function at at least a rate of twice per cycle, or at least samples per second. On a 10-second interval, we therefore need at least samples, so we should do so at least every seconds.    Since the theorem says to sample at a minimum of double the maximum desired frequency, and humans can't detect signals above KHz, it follows that double KHz is KHz, or Hz, so sampling at Hz slightly exceeds the minimum sampling needed by the formal result.

However, its very short half-life (1.5-5 min) in plasma represents a major limitation for its use in the clinical setting.

  "body": " Continuous data is the basis for analog information, like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records. A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information. For example, the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second. So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information. Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for, among other things, noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space. While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter, this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.  Let be the continuous function defined by on the interval . A graph of is shown in Figure .   The graph of on the interval    We approximate by sampling , that is by partitioning the interval into uniform subintervals and recording the values of at the endpoints.   Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal. As an example, partition the interval into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points (the sample ) using the endpoints of each subinterval. Plot your sample on graph of in Figure Figure . What can you say about the period of your sample as compared to the period of the original function?    The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As the part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called aliasing ). There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the lowest rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points. Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function and determine the number of partitions of the interval that give us the Nyquist rate.    Humans cannot typically pick up signals above 20 kHz. Explain why, then, that information on a compact disk is sampled at 44,100 Hz.         The data points do not appear periodic at all.       At least samples, so at least every seconds.     Hz is slightly more than double KHz.         Sampling the function at the endpoints of equal subintervals of length , we see the data pictured in the following figure (with the sample points in red). While the function is periodic with a period of , the data points do not appear periodic at all as none of them has repeated (yet) over the course of the pictured interval.       Since the period of the function is , its frequency is , which means that this function completes about cycles per second. Doubling this frequncy gives us a value of . This means that we should sample the function at at least a rate of twice per cycle, or at least samples per second. On a 10-second interval, we therefore need at least samples, so we should do so at least every seconds.    Since the theorem says to sample at a minimum of double the maximum desired frequency, and humans can't detect signals above KHz, it follows that double KHz is KHz, or Hz, so sampling at Hz slightly exceeds the minimum sampling needed by the formal result.

There is an old question that is often used to introduce the power of geometric growth. Here is one version. Suppose you are hired for a one month (30 days, working every day) job and are given two options to be paid.     Option 1.  You can be paid $500 per day or    Option 2.  You can be paid 1 cent the first day, 2 cents the second day, 4 cents the third day, 8 cents the fourth day, and so on, doubling the amount you are paid each day.        How much will you be paid for the job in total under Option 1?    Complete Table to determine the pay you will receive under Option 2 for the first 10 days.

Use this formula to determine which option (1 or 2) you should take.          dollars.       Day  Pay on this day  Total amount paid to date                                                          .         You will be paid dollars under Option 1.       Day  Pay on this day  Total amount paid to date                                                         On day you are paid dollars and the total amount paid is . So on day 30 under Option 2 the total payment will be , so Option 2 is definitely the better deal.       Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height . The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height. The ball will then fall again to the ground, bounce back up, and continue. Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height of the height from which it dropped. Let be the height of the ball on the th bounce, with . In this exercise we will determine the distance traveled by the ball and the time it takes to travel that distance.   Determine a formula for in terms of .    Determine a formula for in terms of .    Determine a formula for in terms of .    Determine a formula for in terms of .    Write an infinite series that represents the total distance traveled by the ball. Then determine the sum of this series.    Next, let's determine the total amount of time the ball is in the air.   When the ball is dropped from a height , if we assume the only force acting on it is the acceleration due to gravity, then the height of the ball at time is given by . Use this formula to determine the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground after being dropped from height .    Use your work in the preceding item, along with that in (a)-(e) above to determine the total amount of time the ball is in the air.             .     .     .     .    The distance traveled by the ball is , which is finite.         Since the ball bounces back of the original height, we have .    Since the ball bounces back of the original height, we have .    Since the ball bounces back of the original height, we have .    Since the ball bounces back of the original height, we have .    The distance traveled by the ball is .  So no matter what the initial height of the ball, the ball will bounce infinitely many times but only travel a finite distance.       Suppose you play a game with a friend that involves rolling a standard six-sided die. Before a player can participate in the game, he or she must roll a six with the die. Assume that you roll first and that you and your friend take alternate rolls. In this exercise we will determine the probability that you roll the first six.     Explain why the probability of rolling a six on any single roll (including your first turn) is .    If you don't roll a six on your first turn, then in order for you to roll the first six on your second turn, both you and your friend had to fail to roll a six on your first turns, and then you had to succeed in rolling a six on your second turn. Explain why the probability of this event is .    Now suppose you fail to roll the first six on your second turn. Explain why the probability is that you to roll the first six on your third turn.    The probability of you rolling the first six is the probability that you roll the first six on your first turn plus the probability that you roll the first six on your second turn plus the probability that your roll the first six on your third turn, and so on. Explain why this probability is . Find the sum of this series and determine the probability that you roll the first six.         There are equally possible outcomes when we roll one die.    The three rolls are independent so the probability of the overall outcome is the product of the three probabilities.    See (b).     .         There are equally possible outcomes when we roll one die, and only one of those is a , so the probability that a appears when we roll the die is .    On the first roll, the probability of not rolling a is . This is the same on the second roll, so the probability of not rolling a on either of the first two rolls is , since the two events are independent. If we then roll a on the following turn, the probability of doing so in that roll is , so with the three rolls being independent, the probability of you rolling a on your second turn (the third overall roll) is .    The exact same reasoning as in (b), but with dice rolls instead of , shows that .    By simply summing the probabilities to consider all of the possible outcomes (rolling on your first turn, doing so on your second, etc.), we get that the total probability of you rolling a on one of your turns is , which is a geometric series with and . Since we know that a geometric series has sum , it follows that , so by going first your odds are just slightly better than half that you'll be the first one to roll a .       The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of billion of dollars. Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals dollars for each person.     The tax cut of dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?    In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut\/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75% of this income. After this ``second round\" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut\/rebate?    This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75% of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the multiplier effect . Explain why an original tax cut\/rebate of dollars will result in multiplied spending of . dollars.    Based on these assumptions, how much stimulus will a 200 billion dollar tax cut\/rebate to consumers add to the economy, assuming consumer spending remains consistent forever.          dollars spent.     dollars.     dollars.    A stimulus of billion dollars adds billion dollars to the economy.         Given that 75% of income is spent, this tax cut\/rebate will result in dollars spent.    The amount of money introduced into the economy is the amount after the original cut plus 75% of that income from spending. So the total amount of money added to the economy is dollars.    The st round of spending will result in income of dollars, of which or will be spent. So each round of spending adds a factor to the total amount, giving us a total amount of spending in the economy of dollars.    Using the sum of a geometric series with ratio shows that .  So a stimulus of 200 billion dollars adds 600 billion dollars to the economy.       Like stimulus packages, home mortgages and foreclosures also impact the economy. A problem for many borrowers is the adjustable rate mortgage, in which the interest rate can change (and usually increases) over the duration of the loan, causing the monthly payments to increase beyond the ability of the borrower to pay. Most financial analysts recommend fixed rate loans, ones for which the monthly payments remain constant throughout the term of the loan. In this exercise we will analyze fixed rate loans.  When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house, they have to take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. With a loan, we borrow money, say dollars (called the principal), and pay off the loan at an interest rate of %. To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments, some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest. In most cases, the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month. We assume a fixed rate loan, that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment on our loan, beginning in the original month of the loan.  Suppose you want to buy a house. You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment, and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house. Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money, the bank will charge you interest on this loan, so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow. In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things: the amount you borrow (called the principal ), the interest rate, and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the duration of the loan). For this example, we assume that the interest rate is fixed at %.  To pay off the loan, each month you make a payment of the same amount (called installments ). Suppose we borrow dollars (our principal) and pay off the loan at an interest rate of % with regular monthly installment payments of dollars. So in month 1 of the loan, before we make any payments, our principal is dollars. Our goal in this exercise is to find a formula that relates these three parameters to the time duration of the loan.  We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of %, so each month we pay % interest on the principal that remains. Given that the original principal is dollars, we will pay dollars in interest on our first payment. Since we paid dollars in total for our first payment, the remainder of the payment ( ) goes to pay down the principal. So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it ) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or .  As long as is positive, we still have to keep making payments to pay off the loan.     Recall that the amount of interest we pay each time depends on the principal that remains. How much interest, in terms of and , do we pay in the second installment?    How much of our second monthly installment goes to pay off the principal? What is the principal , or the balance of the loan, that we still have to pay off after making the second installment of the loan? Write your response in the form , where you fill in the parentheses.    Show that .    Let be the amount of principal that remains after the third installment. Show that .    If we continue in the manner described in the problems above, then the remaining principal of our loan after installments is . This is a rather complicated formula and one that is difficult to use. However, we can simplify the sum if we recognize part of it as a partial sum of a geometric series. Find a formula for the sum . and then a general formula for that does not involve a sum.    It is usually more convenient to write our formula for in terms of years rather than months. Show that , the principal remaining after years, can be written as .    Now that we have analyzed the general loan situation, we apply formula to an actual loan. Suppose we charge $1,000 on a credit card for holiday expenses. If our credit card charges 20% interest and we pay only the minimum payment of $25 each month, how long will it take us to pay off the $1,000 charge? How much in total will we have paid on this $1,000 charge? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?    Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment that will take our outstanding principal to in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of that makes in formula . If we set and solve for , it follows that .     Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?    Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?    Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:     30 years at 6.5%    25 years at 7.5%    15 years at 8.25%.        What are the monthly payments for each loan?    Which mortgage is ultimately the best deal (assuming you can afford the monthly payments)? In other words, for which loan do you pay the least amount of total interest?                dollars.     .     .     .   .     .          .   .  We pay $659 dollars in interest on our $1000 loan.    $291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years; we pay $2,504.40 in interest.         In the second installment, we are charged dollars in interest.    The amount of our payment that doesn't go toward interest is applied toward the principal. So we reduce our principal by dollars. Therefore, the balance of our loan after the second installment is .    We know , so we substitute for and simplify: .    For the third payment we are charged dollars in interest. So dollars goes toward paying down the principal. Then .  So , so we substitute for and simplify: .    The sum in is a partial sum of the geometric series with ratio . So formula shows that the partial sum is equal to .  Now we can determine that the remaining principal after installments is .    To put our payments into a yearly context which is more convenient, we know that there are months in years. So we can say that the principal remaining at the end of years is which reduces to .    Under these conditions, the principal in the account at the end of years will be .  To determine how long it will take us to pay off the card, we need to find the time so that . When we have .  So it would take over 5.5 years to pay off the debt. At $25 per month, we will have paid approximately dollars on our original $1,000 charge. In other words, we pay $659 dollars in interest on our $1000 loan.    We need to find the value of in our formula: .  So we need to pay $291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years. During that time we spend a total of dollars on the loan or $2,504.40 in interest.       "

  "body": " The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of billion of dollars. Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals dollars for each person.     The tax cut of dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?    In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut\/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75% of this income. After this ``second round\" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut\/rebate?    This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75% of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the multiplier effect . Explain why an original tax cut\/rebate of dollars will result in multiplied spending of . dollars.

A stimulus of billion dollars adds billion dollars to the economy.         Given that 75% of income is spent, this tax cut\/rebate will result in dollars spent.    The amount of money introduced into the economy is the amount after the original cut plus 75% of that income from spending. So the total amount of money added to the economy is dollars.    The st round of spending will result in income of dollars, of which or will be spent. So each round of spending adds a factor to the total amount, giving us a total amount of spending in the economy of dollars.    Using the sum of a geometric series with ratio shows that .

  "body": " Like stimulus packages, home mortgages and foreclosures also impact the economy. A problem for many borrowers is the adjustable rate mortgage, in which the interest rate can change (and usually increases) over the duration of the loan, causing the monthly payments to increase beyond the ability of the borrower to pay. Most financial analysts recommend fixed rate loans, ones for which the monthly payments remain constant throughout the term of the loan. In this exercise we will analyze fixed rate loans.  When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house, they have to take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. With a loan, we borrow money, say dollars (called the principal), and pay off the loan at an interest rate of %. To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments, some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest. In most cases, the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month. We assume a fixed rate loan, that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment on our loan, beginning in the original month of the loan.  Suppose you want to buy a house. You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment, and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house. Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money, the bank will charge you interest on this loan, so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow. In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things: the amount you borrow (called the principal ), the interest rate, and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the duration of the loan). For this example, we assume that the interest rate is fixed at %.  To pay off the loan, each month you make a payment of the same amount (called installments ). Suppose we borrow dollars (our principal) and pay off the loan at an interest rate of % with regular monthly installment payments of dollars. So in month 1 of the loan, before we make any payments, our principal is dollars. Our goal in this exercise is to find a formula that relates these three parameters to the time duration of the loan.  We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of %, so each month we pay % interest on the principal that remains. Given that the original principal is dollars, we will pay dollars in interest on our first payment. Since we paid dollars in total for our first payment, the remainder of the payment ( ) goes to pay down the principal. So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it ) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or .  As long as is positive, we still have to keep making payments to pay off the loan.     Recall that the amount of interest we pay each time depends on the principal that remains. How much interest, in terms of and , do we pay in the second installment?    How much of our second monthly installment goes to pay off the principal? What is the principal , or the balance of the loan, that we still have to pay off after making the second installment of the loan? Write your response in the form , where you fill in the parentheses.    Show that .    Let be the amount of principal that remains after the third installment. Show that .    If we continue in the manner described in the problems above, then the remaining principal of our loan after installments is . This is a rather complicated formula and one that is difficult to use. However, we can simplify the sum if we recognize part of it as a partial sum of a geometric series. Find a formula for the sum . and then a general formula for that does not involve a sum.    It is usually more convenient to write our formula for in terms of years rather than months. Show that , the principal remaining after years, can be written as .    Now that we have analyzed the general loan situation, we apply formula to an actual loan. Suppose we charge $1,000 on a credit card for holiday expenses. If our credit card charges 20% interest and we pay only the minimum payment of $25 each month, how long will it take us to pay off the $1,000 charge? How much in total will we have paid on this $1,000 charge? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?    Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment that will take our outstanding principal to in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of that makes in formula . If we set and solve for , it follows that .     Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?    Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?    Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:     30 years at 6.5%    25 years at 7.5%    15 years at 8.25%.        What are the monthly payments for each loan?    Which mortgage is ultimately the best deal (assuming you can afford the monthly payments)? In other words, for which loan do you pay the least amount of total interest?                dollars.     .     .     .   .     .          .   .  We pay $659 dollars in interest on our $1000 loan.    $291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years; we pay $2,504.40 in interest.         In the second installment, we are charged dollars in interest.    The amount of our payment that doesn't go toward interest is applied toward the principal. So we reduce our principal by dollars. Therefore, the balance of our loan after the second installment is .    We know , so we substitute for and simplify: .    For the third payment we are charged dollars in interest. So dollars goes toward paying down the principal. Then .  So , so we substitute for and simplify: .    The sum in is a partial sum of the geometric series with ratio . So formula shows that the partial sum is equal to .  Now we can determine that the remaining principal after installments is .    To put our payments into a yearly context which is more convenient, we know that there are months in years. So we can say that the principal remaining at the end of years is which reduces to .    Under these conditions, the principal in the account at the end of years will be .  To determine how long it will take us to pay off the card, we need to find the time so that . When we have .  So it would take over 5.5 years to pay off the debt. At $25 per month, we will have paid approximately dollars on our original $1,000 charge. In other words, we pay $659 dollars in interest on our $1000 loan.    We need to find the value of in our formula: .  So we need to pay $291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years. During that time we spend a total of dollars on the loan or $2,504.40 in interest.     "

In Section , we encountered infinite geometric series. For example, by writing as a geometric series, we found a way to write as a single fraction: . In this section, we explore other types of infinite sums. In Preview Activity we see how one such sum is related to the famous number .    Have you ever wondered how your calculator can produce a numeric approximation for complicated numbers like , or ? After all, the only operations a calculator can really perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the operations that make up polynomials. This activity provides the first steps in understanding how this process works. Throughout the activity, let .     Find the tangent line to at and use this linearization to approximate . That is, find a formula for the tangent line, and compute , since .    The linearization of does not provide a good approximation to since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate , we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of for close to 0. With the linearization, we had both and share the same value as the linearization at . We will now use a quadratic approximation to centered at which has the property that , , and .     Let . Show that , , and . Then, use to approximate by observing that .    We can continue approximating with polynomials of larger degree whose higher derivatives agree with those of at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph of better for more values of around 0. For example, let . Show that , , , and . Use to approximate in a way similar to how you did so with above.             The linearization of at is , so the linearization of at is .  Now for close to and so .       The derivatives of and are , and so the derivatives of and evaluated at 0 are .  Then .    The derivatives of and are , and so the derivatives of and evaluated at 0 are .  Then .            Infinite Series   Preview Activity shows that an approximation to using a linear polynomial is 2, an approximation to using a quadratic polynomial is , and an approximation using a cubic polynomial is 2.6667. If we continue this process we can obtain approximations from quartic (degree 4) and quintic (degree 5) polynomials, giving us the following approximations to :     linear      quadratic      cubic      quartic      quintic       We see an interesting pattern here. The number is being approximated by the sum for increasing values of .  We can use summation notation as a shorthand Note that appears in Equation . By definition, . for writing the sum in Equation to get .  We can calculate this sum using as large an as we want, and the larger is the more accurate the approximation is. This suggests that we can write the number as the infinite sum .  This sum is an example of an infinite series . infinite series Note that the series is the sum of the terms of the infinite sequence . In general, we use the following notation and terminology.    An infinite series of real numbers is the sum of the entries in an infinite sequence of real numbers. In other words, an infinite series is sum of the form , where , , , are real numbers.    We use summation notation to identify a series. If the series adds the entries of a sequence , we will write the series as or .  Each of these notations is simply shorthand for the infinite sum .  Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers? That doing so is possible in some situations shouldn't come as a surprise. We have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section. Moreover, the definite integral is defined as the limit of a sequence of finite sums, which provides insight into how we'll think of infinite sums generally. As we investigate other infinite sums, there are two key questions we seek to answer: (1) is the sum finite? and (2) if yes, what is its value?    Consider the series .  While it is physically impossible to add an infinite collection of numbers, we can, of course, add any finite collection of them. In what follows, we investigate how understanding how to find the th partial sum (that is, the sum of the first terms) enables us to make sense of the infinite sum.   Sum the first two numbers in this series. That is, find a numeric value for     Next, add the first three numbers in the series.    Continue adding terms in this series to complete the list below. Carry each sum to at least 8 decimal places.                      The sums in the table in part form a sequence whose th term is . Based on your calculations in the table, do you think the sequence converges or diverges? Explain. How do you think this sequence is related to the series ?          Compute .    Do likewise but include the third term, .    Note that you can use your work in each previous stage and just add one more term to get the next desired sum.    Look for a pattern in the numbers you computed in part (c).          See the table in part .    See the table in part .                                    It appears converges to something a bit larger than 1.5.          See the table in part .    See the table in part .    If we add the first few terms of the sequence we obtain the entries (to 10 decimal places) in the following table.                                    These sums in the table in part (c) seem to indicate that the sequence converges to something a bit larger than 1.5. Since the sequence is found by adding up the first terms of the series, we should expect that the series is the limit of the sequence as goes to infinity.       The example in Activity illustrates how we define the sum of an infinite series. We construct a new sequence of numbers (called the sequence of partial sums ) partial sum  sequence of partial sums where the th term in the sequence consists of the sum of the first terms of the series. If this sequence converges, the corresponding infinite series is said to converge, and we say that we can find the sum of the series. More formally, we have the following definition.    The th partial sum of the series is the finite sum .    In other words, the th partial sum of a series is the sum of the first terms in the series, .  We investigate the behavior of the series by examining the sequence of its partial sums. If the sequence of partial sums converges to some finite number, we say that the corresponding series converges . series converges Otherwise, we say the series diverges . series diverges From our work in Activity , the series appears to converge to some number near 1.54977. We formalize the concept of convergence and divergence of an infinite series in the following definition.    The infinite series    converges (or is convergent ) if the sequence of partial sums converges, where .  If , then we call the sum of the series . That is, .  If the sequence of partial sums does not converge, then the series    diverges (or is divergent ).    The early terms in a series do not influence whether or not the series converges or diverges. Rather, the convergence or divergence of a series is determined by what happens to the terms for very large values of . To see why, suppose that is some constant larger than 1. Then .  Since is a finite number, the series will converge if and only if the series converges. Because the starting index of the series doesn't affect whether the series converges or diverges, we will often just write when we are interested in questions of convergence\/divergence as opposed to the exact sum of a series.  In Section we encountered the special family of infinite geometric series. Recall that a geometric series has the form , where and are real numbers (and ). We found that the th partial sum of a geometric series is given by the convenient formula , and thus a geometric series converges if . Geometric series diverge for all other values of .  It is generally a difficult question to determine if a given nongeometric series converges or diverges. There are several tests we can use that we will consider in the following sections.    The Divergence Test  The first question we ask about any infinite series is usually Does the series converge or diverge? There is a straightforward way to check that certain series diverge, and we explore this test in the next activity.    If the series  converges, then an important result necessarily follows regarding the sequence  . This activity explores this result.  Assume that the series converges and has sum equal to .   What is the th partial sum of the series ?    What is the st partial sum of the series ?    What is the difference between the th partial sum and the st partial sum of the series ?    Since we are assuming that , what does that tell us about ? Why? What does that tell us about ? Why?    Combine the results of the previous two parts of this activity to determine .          Recall that the th partial sum is the sum of the first terms.    Consider the sum with one fewer term.    Subtract your results in (a) and (b).    Remember that the partials sums have to tend to the sum of the series.    Note that and .           .     .     .     and .    We have .          The th partial sum of the series is .    The st partial sum of the series is .    The difference between and is .    Since we must have . Also, , so as well.    We have .       The result of Activity is the following important conditional statement:   If the series converges, then the sequence of th terms converges to 0.   It is logically equivalent to say that if the sequence does not converge to 0, then the series cannot converge. This statement is called the Divergence Test. Divergence Test    The Divergence Test  If , then the series diverges.     Determine if the Divergence Test applies to the following series. If the test does not apply, explain why. If the test does apply, what does it tell us about the series?                        Consider .    Think about the partial sums of this series.    Remember that if the terms of a series go to zero, the Divergence Test doesn't make any claims.           diverges.     diverges.    The Divergence Test does not apply.          Since the sequence converges to 1 and not 0 as goes to infinity, the Divergence Test applies here and shows that the series diverges.    Since the terms of this series don't even converge to a number, they can't converge to zero, and thus this series diverges.    Since , the Divergence Test does not apply to this series.        Note well: be very careful with the Divergence Test. This test only tells us what happens to a series if the terms of the corresponding sequence do not converge to 0. If the sequence of the terms of the series does converge to 0, the Divergence Test does not apply: indeed, as we will soon see, a series whose terms go to zero may either converge or diverge.    The Integral Test  integral test  The Divergence Test settles the questions of divergence or convergence of series in which . Determining the convergence or divergence of series in which turns out to be more complicated. Often, we have to investigate the sequence of partial sums or apply some other technique.  Next, we consider the harmonic series  harmonic series This series is called harmonic because each term in the series after the first is the harmonic mean of the term before it and the term after it. The harmonic mean of two numbers and is . See What's Harmonic about the Harmonic Series , by David E. Kullman (in the College Mathematics Journal , Vol. 32, No. 3 (May, 2001), 201-203) for an interesting discussion of the harmonic mean. . The first 9 partial sums of this series are shown following.   This information alone doesn't seem to be enough to tell us if the series converges or diverges. The partial sums could eventually level off to some fixed number or continue to grow without bound. Even if we look at larger partial sums, such as , the result isn't particularly convincing one way or another. The Integral Test is one way to determine whether or not the harmonic series converges, and we explore this test further in the next activity.    Consider the harmonic series . Recall that the harmonic series will converge provided that its sequence of partial sums converges. The th partial sum of the series is .  Through this last expression for , we can visualize this partial sum as a sum of areas of rectangles with heights and bases of length 1, as shown in Figure , which uses the 9th partial sum.   A picture of the 9th partial sum of the harmonic series as a sum of areas of rectangles.    The graph of the continuous function defined by is overlaid on this plot.   Explain how this picture represents a particular Riemann sum.    What is the definite integral that corresponds to the Riemann sum you considered in (a)?    Which is larger, the definite integral in (b), or the corresponding partial sum of the series? Why?    If instead of considering the 9th partial sum, we consider the th partial sum, and we let go to infinity, we can then compare the series to the improper integral . Which of these quantities is larger? Why?    Does the improper integral converge or diverge? What does that result, together with your work in (d), tell us about the series ?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.          The th partial sum of the series is the left hand Riemann sum of on the interval .     .     .     so the series diverges.          Notice that the th partial sum of the series is equal to the left hand Riemann sum of on the interval .    Since is a decreasing function, it follows that .    Letting Since is decreasing, the improper integral is smaller than the limit of the Riemann sums as goes to infinity. So we wind up with a comparison between the series and the improper integral: .    We can evaluate the improper integral as follows: . Since the value of the series exceeds the value of the infinite improper integral, we must conclude that the series diverges.       The ideas from Activity hold more generally. Suppose that is a continuous decreasing function and that for each value of . Consider the corresponding series . The partial sum can always be viewed as a left hand Riemann sum of , using rectangles with bases of width 1 and heights given by the values . A representative picture is shown at left in Figure . Since is a decreasing function, we have that .  Taking the limit as goes to infinity shows that .  Therefore, if the improper integral diverges, so does the series .   Comparing an improper integral to a series       What's more, if we look at the right hand Riemann sums of on as shown at right in Figure , we see that .  So if converges, then so does , which also means that the series also converges. Our preceding discussion has demonstrated the truth of the Integral Test. integral test    The Integral Test  Let be a real valued function and assume is decreasing and positive for all larger than some number . Let for each positive integer .   If the improper integral converges, then the series converges.    If the improper integral diverges, then the series diverges.      The Integral Test compares a given infinite series to a natural, corresponding improper integral and says that the infinite series and corresponding improper integral both have the same convergence status. In the next activity, we apply the Integral Test to determine the convergence or divergence of a class of important series.    The series are special series called -series. We have already seen that the -series with (the harmonic series) diverges. We investigate the behavior of other -series in this activity.   Evaluate the improper integral . Does the series converge or diverge? Explain.    Evaluate the improper integral where . For which values of can we conclude that the series converges?    Evaluate the improper integral where . What does this tell us about the corresponding -series ?    Summarize your work in this activity by completing the following statement.   The -series converges if and only if .           Small hints for each of the prompts above.           converges.     converges when .     diverges when .     The -series converges if and only if .           We evaluate the improper integral: . So the improper integral converges. The Integral Test then shows that the series converges.    Assume . Then and so and . Thus, . So the improper integral converges when . The Integral Test then shows that the series converges when .    Assume . Then and so . Thus, . So the improper integral diverges when . The Integral Test then shows that the series also diverges when .    We complete the statement as   The -series converges if and only if .          The Limit Comparison Test  limit comparison test  The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series: the -series. However, we have seen that it is often difficult to integrate functions, so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time. In fact, even for a relatively simple series such as , the Integral Test is not an option. In what follows we develop a test that applies to series of rational functions by comparing their behavior to the behavior of -series.    Consider the series . Since the convergence or divergence of a series only depends on the behavior of the series for large values of , we might examine the terms of this series more closely as gets large.   By computing the value of for and , explain why the terms are essentially when is large.    Let's formalize our observations in (a) a bit more. Let and . Calculate . What does the value of the limit tell you about and for large values of ? Compare your response from part (a).    Does the series converge or diverge? Why? What do you think that tells us about the convergence or divergence of the series ? Explain.          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           looks like when is large.     so for large values of .     converges.          When is very large, the constant 1 in the numerator is negligible compared to and the constant 2 in the denominator is negligible compared to . So the numerator looks like and the denominator when is large. It follows that looks like when is large.    Note that . This tells us that for large values of , which is what we suggested in part (a).    Since , the series is a -series with and so converges. Since for large values of , it seems reasonable to expect that for large s. Since is finite, we should then conclude that is also finite. So should be a convergent series.        Activity illustrates how we can compare one series with positive terms to another whose convergence status we know. Suppose we have two series and with positive terms and we know the convergence status of the series . Recall that the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on the terms of the series for large values of , so if we know that and are proportional for large , then the two series and should behave the same way. In other words, if there is a positive finite constant such that , then for large values of . So .  Since multiplying by a nonzero constant does not affect the convergence or divergence of a series, it follows that the series and either both converge or both diverge. The formal statement of this fact is called the Limit Comparison Test.   The Limit Comparison Test  Let and be series with positive terms. If for some positive (finite) constant , then and either both converge or both diverge.   The Limit Comparison Test shows that if we have a series of rational functions where is a polynomial of degree and a polynomial of degree , then the series will behave like the series . So this test allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of series whose terms are rational functions.    Use the Limit Comparison Test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series . by comparing it to the series .       Small hints for each of the prompts above.        converges.    Let and . Then .  Since is a finite positive constant, the Limit Comparison Test shows that and either both converge or both diverge. We know that is a -series with and so converges. Therefore, the series also converges.      The Ratio Test  ratio test  The Limit Comparison Test works well if we can find a series with known behavior to compare. But such series are not always easy to find. In this section we will examine a test that allows us to examine the behavior of a series by comparing it to a geometric series, without knowing in advance which geometric series we need.    Consider the series defined by .  This series is not a geometric series, but this activity will illustrate how we might compare this series to a geometric one. Recall that a series is geometric if the ratio is always the same. For the series in , note that .   To see if is comparable to a geometric series, we analyze the ratios of successive terms in the series. Complete Table , listing your calculations to at least 8 decimal places.   Ratios of successive terms in the series                             Based on your calculations in Table , what can we say about the ratio if is large?    Do you agree or disagree with the statement: the series is approximately geometric when is large ? If not, why not? If so, do you think the series converges or diverges? Explain.                  0.6583679115     0.6665951585     0.6666666642     0.6666666658     0.6666666664     0.6666666666     0.6666666666     0.6666666667        when is large.     converges.          Ratios of successive summands in the series are shown (to 10 decimal places) in the following table.          0.6583679115     0.6665951585     0.6666666642     0.6666666658     0.6666666664     0.6666666666     0.6666666666     0.6666666667       The calculations in the table in part (a) seem to indicate that the ratio is roughly when is large.    Since for large , the series is approximately the same as when is large. So the series is approximately geometric with ratio when is large. Since the series converges because the ratio is less than 1, we expect that the series will also converge.       We can generalize the argument in Activity in the following way. Consider the series . If for large values of , then for large and the series is approximately the geometric series for large . Since the geometric series with ratio converges only for , we see that the series will converge if for a value of such that . This result is known as the Ratio Test.   The Ratio Test  Let be an infinite series. Suppose .   If , then the series converges.    If , then the series diverges.    If , then the test is inconclusive.       Note well: The Ratio Test looks at the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms of a given series; in so doing, the test is asking, is this series approximately geometric? If so, the test uses the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms to determine if the given series converges.  We have now encountered several tests for determining convergence or divergence of series.  The Divergence Test can be used to show that a series diverges, but never to prove that a series converges.  We used the Integral Test to determine the convergence status of an entire class of series, the -series.  The Limit Comparison Test works well for series that involve rational functions and which can therefore by compared to -series.  Finally, the Ratio Test allows us to compare our series to a geometric series; it is particularly useful for series that involve th powers and factorials.  Two other tests, the Direct Comparison Test and the Root Test, are discussed in the exercises.  One of the challenges of determining whether a series converges or diverges is finding which test answers that question.    Determine whether each of the following series converges or diverges. Explicitly state which test you use.                             Small hints for each of the prompts above.           converges.     diverges.     converges.     converges.          Since , the Divergence Test does not apply. The Ratio Test is a good one to apply with series whose terms involve exponentials and polynomials.  In this example we have and . So . As goes to infinity, the fraction goes to 1 and so . So in this example, for large we have that or that is roughly a geometric series for large with ratio . Since geometric series with ratio converges, we can conclude that converges as well.    For this series, notice that the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, so . Since this limit is not 0, the Divergence Test shows that diverges.    We use the Ratio Test here with . Now , so the Ratio Test shows that converges.    If we ignore the highest powered terms, then the series looks like the series . We formally apply the Limit Comparison Test as follows: . Since is a -series with , the series converges. Consequently, the Limit Comparison Test shows that converges as well.         Summary     An infinite series is a sum of the elements in an infinite sequence. In other words, an infinite series is a sum of the form where is a real number for each positive integer .    The th partial sum of the series is the sum of the first terms of the series. That is, .    The sequence of partial sums of a series tells us about the convergence or divergence of the series. In particular   The series converges if the sequence of partial sums converges. In this case we say that the series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums and write .    The series diverges if the sequence of partial sums diverges.          Convergence of a sequence and its series   Given:   Determine:  (a) whether is convergent.  (b) whether is convergent.  If convergent, enter the limit of convergence. If not, enter DIV.                 Two partial sums   Consider the series . Let be the n-th partial sum; that is,   Find and  =  =                 Convergence of a series and its sequence   Let For the following answer blanks, decide whether the given sequence or series is convergent or divergent. If convergent, enter the limit (for a sequence) or the sum (for a series). If divergent, enter 'infinity' if it diverges to , '-infinity' if it diverges to or 'DNE' otherwise.  (a) The series .  (b) The sequence .                   Convergence of an integral and a related series   Compute the value of the following improper integral. If it converges, enter its value. Enter infinity if it diverges to , and -infinity if it diverges to . Otherwise, enter diverges.  =  Does the series converge or diverge?   converges    diverges to +infinity    diverges to -infinity    diverges                        In this exercise we investigate the sequence for any constant .     Use the Ratio Test to determine if the series converges or diverges.    Now apply the Ratio Test to determine if the series converges for any constant .    Use your result from (b) to decide whether the sequence converges or diverges. If the sequence converges, to what does it converge? Explain your reasoning.          converges.     converges.    The sequence has to converge to 0.         We use the Ratio Test with . First we consider the ratios of successive terms: .  Since the limit of the ratio of successive terms is less than 1, we conclude that the series converges.    We use the Ratio Test with . First we consider the ratios of successive terms: .  Since the limit of the ratio of successive terms is less than 1, we conclude that the series converges.    Since the series converges, the Divergence Test tells us that the sequence has to converge to 0.       There is a test for convergence similar to the Ratio Test called the Root Test . Suppose we have a series of positive terms so that as .     Assume as goes to infinity. Explain why this tells us that for large values of .    Using the result of part (a), explain why looks like a geometric series when is big. What is the ratio of the geometric series to which is comparable?    Use what we know about geometric series to determine that values of so that converges if as .          for large .     .     .         Since for large , it follows for large .    Because for large , this means that the series acts like the series for sufficiently large . The latter is a geometric series with ratio between successive terms. Said differently, .    Since the terms in our series are all positive, we must have . Now the geometric series with ratio converges only for ,so the series will converge if with .       The associative and distributive laws of addition allow us to add finite sums in any order we want. That is, if and are finite sums of real numbers, then .  However, we do need to be careful extending rules like this to infinite series.   Let and for each nonnegative integer .   Explain why the series and both diverge.    Explain why the series converges.    Explain why . This shows that it is possible to have to two divergent series and but yet have the series converge.       While part (a) shows that we cannot add series term by term in general, we can under reasonable conditions. The problem in part (a) is that we tried to add divergent series. In this exercise we will show that if and are convergent series, then is a convergent series and .   Let and be the th partial sums of the series and , respectively. Explain why .    Use the previous result and properties of limits to show that . (Note that the starting point of the sum is irrelevant in this problem, so it doesn't matter where we begin the sum.)       Use the prior result to find the sum of the series .             and .    The series is geometric with .    Since the two individual series diverge, neither sum is a finite number, so it doesn't make any sense to add them.          Note that .    Note that .        .            Since and as , by the Divergence Test both and diverge.    However, the series converges because the series is geometric with .    The issue is that it doesn't make any sense to talk about . when and diverge. Since those series diverge, neither sum is a finite number, so it doesn't make any sense to add them.          Let and be the th partial sums of the series and , respectively. By definition, . Expanding these finite sums, we have . By the associative and commutative properties of finite sums, we can rearrange these sums in any order we wish, and also group the terms in any pairings we wish. Thus, , and therefore .    The last equality we demonstrated above tells us that . In this equality, we can take the limit of both sides as . On the right side, we know that both and exist because the two series converge, and therefore the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits. Hence, . Thus we have shown that .       Since both and are convergent geometric series, we can apply the result from the last exercise above to say that . Applying the known sum of geometric series to each sum on the right, we then have .       In the Limit Comparison Test we compared the behavior of a series to one whose behavior we know. In that test we use the limit of the ratio of corresponding terms of the series to determine if the comparison is valid. In this exercise we see how we can compare two series directly, term by term, without using a limit of sequence. First we consider an example.     Consider the series . We know that the series is a -series with and so converges. In this part of the exercise we will see how to use information about to determine information about . Let and .     Let be the th partial sum of and the th partial sum of . Which is larger, or ? Why?    Recall that . Which is larger, or ? Based on that answer, which is larger, or ?    Recall that . Which is larger, or ? Based on that answer, which is larger, or ?    Which is larger, or ? Explain. Based on that answer, which is larger, or ?    Based on your response to the previous part of this exercise, what relationship do you expect there to be between and ? Do you expect to converge or diverge? Why?       The example in the previous part of this exercise illustrates a more general result. Explain why the Direct Comparison Test, stated here, works.   The Direct Comparison Test  If for every , then we must have    If converges, then converges.    If diverges, then diverges.       This comparison test applies only to series with nonnegative terms.      Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series . Hint: Compare to the harmonic series.    Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series .                and .     .     .     .     ; converges.       If diverges, then is infinite, and anything larger must also be infinite; if is convergent then anything smaller and positive must also be finite.     Note that .    Note that .               Since and , we see that .    Since and , it is the case that . We already know that , so adding a larger number to than we add to makes .    Since and , it is the case that . We already know that , so adding a larger number to than we add to makes .    Since when is positive, we have or . So at each step, we are adding larger numbers to the partial sums of than we are to the partial sums of , we conclude that .    Since , we should expect or .  Since is a -series with , we know that converges (and is finite). Now is a sum of positive terms and is therefore positive, and is also less than a finite number ( ), so we expect that converges as well.       If we have two series and of positive terms with for every , then .  Now if diverges, then is infinite. Anything larger must also be infinite and so must also diverge. On the other hand, if is convergent (that is, finite), then anything smaller and positive must also be finite and so must also converge.     For any we have , so if then it follows that . Since the harmonic series diverges, the Direct Comparison Test shows that the larger series must also diverge.    In this case we know that and so if then . It follows that and so the series is bounded below by 0 and above by the series . Now and so the series is a -series with and converges. The Direct Comparison Test shows that the smaller series must also converge.          "

We will investigate the issue of how quickly an alternating series converges later in this section.    An alternating series is a series of the form , where for each .    We have some flexibility in how we write an alternating series; for example, the series , whose index starts at , is also alternating. As we will soon see, there are several very nice results that hold for alternating series, while alternating series can also demonstrate some unusual behavior.  It is important to remember that most of the series tests we have seen in previous sections apply only to series with nonnegative terms. Alternating series require a different test.    Remember that, by definition, a series converges if and only if its corresponding sequence of partial sums converges.     Calculate the first few partial sums (to 10 decimal places) of the alternating series . Label each partial sum with the notation for an appropriate choice of .    Plot the sequence of partial sums from part (a). What do you notice about this sequence?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.                                              There appears to be a limit for the sequence of partial sums.          The completed table is shown below.                                      The entries in the sequence of partial sums from part (a) is shown in the figure below.   The sequence of partial sums.    Notice that the partial sums seem to oscillate back and forth around some fixed number, getting closer to that fixed number at each successive step. So there appears to be a limit for this sequence of partial sums.        Activity illustrates the general behavior of any convergent alternating series. We see that the partial sums of the alternating harmonic series oscillate around a fixed number that turns out to be the sum of the series.  Recall that if , then the series diverges by the Divergence Test. From this point forward, we will thus only consider alternating series in which the sequence consists of positive numbers that decrease to . The th partial sum is .  Notice that      , and since we have .     and so . But , so . Thus, .     and so . But , so . Thus, .     and so . But , so . Thus, .      This pattern continues as illustrated in Figure (with odd) so that each partial sum lies between the previous two partial sums.   Partial sums of an alternating series     Note further that the absolute value of the difference between the st partial sum and the th partial sum is .  Because the sequence converges to , the distance between successive partial sums becomes as close to zero as we'd like, and thus the sequence of partial sums converges (even though we don't know the exact value to which it converges).  The preceding discussion has demonstrated the truth of the Alternating Series Test. alternating series test    The Alternating Series Test  Given an alternating series , if the sequence of positive terms decreases to 0 as , then the alternating series converges.   Note that if the limit of the sequence is not 0, then the alternating series diverges.    Which series converge and which diverge? Justify your answers.                          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           converges.     diverges.     converges.          Since it follows that and the sequence decreases to 0. The Alternating Series Test shows then that the series converges.    In this case we have that and so the sequence of th terms does not even converge to 0. So the series diverges by the Divergence Test.    We know that the natural log is an increasing function, so is a decreasing function. It is also true that and so the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.         Estimating Alternating Sums  If the series converges, the argument for the Alternating Series Test also provides us with a method to determine how close the th partial sum is to the actual sum of the series. To see how this works, let be the sum of a convergent alternating series, so .  Recall that the sequence of partial sums oscillates around the sum so that .  Therefore, the value of the term provides an error estimate for how well the partial sum approximates the actual sum . We summarize this fact in the statement of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. alternating series estimation theorem    Alternating Series Estimation Theorem  If the alternating series has positive terms that decrease to zero as , and is the th partial sum of the alternating series, then .     Determine how well the th partial sum of approximates the sum of the series.    If we let be the sum of the series , then we know that .  Now , so the 100th partial sum is within 0.0099 of the sum of the series. We have discussed the fact (and will later verify) that , and so while .  We see that the actual difference between and is approximately , which is indeed less than .      Determine the number of terms it takes to approximate the sum of the convergent alternating series to within 0.0001.    Small hints for each of the prompts above.     ; .    First note that the sequence decreases to 0, so the series converges by the Alternating Series Test. Let be the sum and the th partial sum of the series. We know that .  So we only need to determine the value of so that .  This happens when or when . So will do. A computer algebra system gives while . These do agree to .      Absolute and Conditional Convergence  absolute convergence  conditional convergence  convergence absolute  convergence conditional  A series such as whose terms are neither all nonnegative nor alternating is different from any series that we have considered so far. The behavior of such a series can be rather complicated, but there is an important connection between a series with some negative terms and series with all positive terms.       Explain why the series must have a sum that is less than the series .    Explain why the series must have a sum that is greater than the series .    Given that the terms in the series converge to 0, what do you think the previous two results tell us about the convergence status of this series?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           .     .    We expect this series to converge to some finite number between and .          Each term in the series is of the form or . Since each of these terms is less than or equal to it follows that .    Each term in the series is of the form or . Since each of these terms is greater than or equal to it follows that .    We know that is a -series with and so is a convergent series. Since , the series also converges. Since the terms in the series converge to 0 and the series itself is bounded between two convergent series, we should expect this series to converge to some finite number between and .       As the example in Activity suggests, if a series has some negative terms but converges, then the original series, , must also converge. That is, if converges, then so must .  As we just observed, this is the case for the series , because the corresponding series of the absolute values of its terms is the convergent -series . But there are series, such as the alternating harmonic series , that converge while the corresponding series of absolute values, , diverges. We distinguish between these behaviors by introducing the following language.    Consider a series .   The series  converges absolutely (or is absolutely convergent ) provided that converges.    The series  converges conditionally (or is conditionally convergent ) provided that diverges and converges.       In this terminology, the series converges absolutely while the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent.       Consider the series .   Does this series converge? Explain.    Does this series converge absolutely? Explain what test you use to determine your answer.       Consider the series .   Does this series converge? Explain.    Does this series converge absolutely? Hint: Use the fact that for large values of and then compare to an appropriate -series.             Small hints for each of the prompts above.              converges.     converges conditionally.         converges.     converges absolutely.                By L'Hôpital's Rule we have . Also, is negative when , so the sequence ultimately decreases to 0. Since the first few terms in a series are irrelevant to its convergence or divergence, we conclude that the series converges by the Alternating Series test.    Note that . Since the improper integral diverges, the Integral Test shows that the series diverges. So the series converges conditionally.        By L'Hôpital's Rule we have . Also, is negative when , so the sequence ultimately decreases to 0. Since the first few terms in a series are irrelevant to its convergence or divergence, we conclude that the series converges by the Alternating Series test.    Notice that , So dominates and for large . It follows that for large . Therefore, for large . Since is a -series with , the series converges. This forces the series to converge as well. So converges absolutely.          Conditionally convergent series turn out to be very interesting. If the sequence decreases to 0, but the series diverges, the conditionally convergent series is right on the borderline of being a divergent series. As a result, any conditionally convergent series converges very slowly. Furthermore, some very strange things can happen with conditionally convergent series, as illustrated in some of the exercises.    Summary of Tests for Convergence of Series  We have discussed several tests for convergence\/divergence of series in our sections and in exercises. We close this section of the text with a summary of all the tests we have encountered, followed by an activity that challenges you to decide which convergence test to apply to several different series.     Geometric Series  The geometric series with ratio converges for and diverges for .  The sum of the convergent geometric series is .    Divergence Test  If the sequence does not converge to 0, then the series diverges.  This is the first test to apply because the conclusion is simple. However, if , no conclusion can be drawn.    Integral Test  Let be a positive, decreasing function on an interval and let for each positive integer .   If converges, then converges.    If diverges, then diverges.     Use this test when is easy to integrate.    Direct Comp. Test  (see Exercise in Section )  Let for each positive integer .   If converges, then converges.    If diverges, then diverges.     Use this test when you have a series with known behavior that you can compare to this test can be difficult to apply.    Limit Comp. Test  Let and be sequences of positive terms. If for some positive finite number , then the two series and either both converge or both diverge.  Easier to apply in general than the comparison test, but you must have a series with known behavior to compare. Useful to apply to series of rational functions.    Ratio Test  Let for each and suppose .   If , then the series converges absolutely.    If , then the series diverges.    If , then test is inconclusive.     This test is useful when a series involves factorials and powers.    Root Test  (see Exercise in Section )  Let for each and suppose .   If , then the series converges.    If , then the series diverges.    If , then test is inconclusive.     In general, the Ratio Test can usually be used in place of the Root Test. However, the Root Test can be quick to use when involves th powers.    Alt. Series Test  If is a positive, decreasing sequence so that , then the alternating series converges.  This test applies only to alternating series we assume that the terms are all positive and that the sequence is decreasing.    Alt. Series Est.  Let be the th partial sum of the alternating series . Assume for each positive integer , the sequence decreases to 0 and . Then it follows that .  This bound can be used to determine the accuracy of the partial sum as an approximation of the sum of a convergent alternating series.       For (a)-(j), use appropriate tests to determine the convergence or divergence of the following series. Throughout, if a series is a convergent geometric series, find its sum.                                                       Determine a value of so that the th partial sum of the alternating series approximates the sum to within 0.001.          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           diverges.     diverges.     diverges.     converges.     is a geometric series with ratio and sum .     converges.     is a convergent geometric series with and and sum .     converges.     converges.     diverges.     converges very slowly.          For large values of , looks like . We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare these two series: . Since this limit is a positive constant, we know that the two series and either both converge or both diverge. Now is constant times a -series with , so diverges. Therefore, diverges as well.    Note that , so the Divergence Test shows that diverges.    For large values of , looks like . We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare these two series: . Since this limit is a positive constant, we know that the two series and either both converge or both diverge. Now is constant times a -series with , so diverges. Therefore, diverges as well.    Series that involve factorials are good candidates for the Ratio Test: . Since this limit is 0, the Ratio Test tells us that the series converges.    Notice that is a geometric series with ratio . Let's write out the first few terms to identify the value of : . So . Since the ratio of this geometric series is between and 1, the series converges. The sum of the series is .    For large values of , looks like . We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare and : . Since this limit is 1, we know that the two series and either both converge or both diverge. Now is a -series with , so converges. Therefore, converges as well.    This series looks geometric, but to be sure let's write out the first few terms of this series: . So is a geometric series with and . Since the ratio of this geometric series is between and 1, the series converges. The sum of the series is .     converges by comparison with the series .    This series is an alternating series of the form with . Since and decreases to 0, the Alternating Series Test shows that converges.    For this example we will use the Integral Test with the substitution , : . Since diverges, we conclude diverges.    First note that the terms decrease to , so the Alternating Series Test shows that the alternating series converges. Let and let be the th partial sum of this series. Recall that where . If we can find a value of so that , then as desired. Now . So if we choose , then approximates the sum of the series to within 0.001. Notice that is a very large number. This shows that the series converges very slowly.         Summary     An alternating series is a series whose terms alternate in sign. It has the form where is a positive real number for each .    The sequence of partial sums of a convergent alternating series oscillates around the sum of the series if the sequence of th terms converges to 0. That is why the Alternating Series Test shows that the alternating series converges whenever the sequence of th terms decreases to 0.    The difference between the st partial sum and the th partial sum of a convergent alternating series is . Since the partial sums oscillate around the sum of the series, it follows that . So the th partial sum of a convergent alternating series approximates the actual sum of the series to within .       Testing convergence for an alternating series   (a) Carefully determine the convergence of the series . The series is   absolutely convergent    conditionally convergent    divergent    (b) Carefully determine the convergence of the series . The series is   absolutely convergent    conditionally convergent    divergent     (a) For , we have . Thus, by the alternating series test, we know that this series converges (it is at least conditionally convergent). Because diverges (because it is a constant times a -series with ), is only conditionally, not absolutely, convergent. (b) For , we have . Thus, by the alternating series test, we know that this series converges (it is at least conditionally convergent). Because also converges (by comparison to a -series or by the integral test), our original series must be not only conditionally convergent but absolutely convergent.        Estimating the sum of an alternating series   For the following alternating series,   how many terms do you have to compute in order for your approximation (your partial sum) to be within 0.0000001 from the convergent value of that series?        satisfying the conditions of the alternating series test, i.e. 1. for all , 2. for all , 3. , we have the error estimate . The given series satisfies the above conditions. Therefore we have to find the first term which is less than or equal 0.0000001. , , , , . Therefore we have to compute the sum of the first 4 terms.      Estimating the sum of a different alternating series   For the following alternating series,   how many terms do you have to go for your approximation (your partial sum) to be within 0.0000001 from the convergent value of that series?            Estimating the sum of one more alternating series   For the following alternating series,   how many terms do you have to go for your approximation (your partial sum) to be within 1e-08 from the convergent value of that series?             Conditionally convergent series converge very slowly. As an example, consider the famous formula We will derive this formula in upcoming work. .  In theory, the partial sums of this series could be used to approximate .     Show that the series in converges conditionally.    Let be the th partial sum of the series in . Calculate the error in approximating with and explain why this is not a very good approximation.    Determine the number of terms it would take in the series to approximate to 10 decimal places. (The fact that it takes such a large number of terms to obtain even a modest degree of accuracy is why we say that conditionally convergent series converge very slowly.)          diverges by comparison to the Harmonic series.     .              Since is an alternating series and , the series converges by the Alternating Series Test. However, the corresponding series of positive terms diverges by comparison to the Harmonic series.     is a considerable amount of error when trying to estimate accurately.    In this case we have .  To have would require .       We have shown that if is a convergent alternating series, then the sum of the series lies between any two consecutive partial sums . This suggests that the average is a better approximation to than is .   Show that .    Use this revised approximation in (a) with to approximate given that . Compare this to the approximation using just . For your convenience, .          .     ; , accurate to within about .         Since we have .    We have two options for estimating using partial sums. For the first one, we use , and note that , so the error in approximating with is about . If we instead use , we get and since , we see that we've obtained a much more accurate approximation of , accurate to within about .       In this exercise, we examine one of the conditions of the Alternating Series Test. Consider the alternating series , where the terms are selected alternately from the sequences and .     Explain why the th term of the given series converges to 0 as goes to infinity.    Rewrite the given series by grouping terms in the following manner: . Use this regrouping to determine if the series converges or diverges.    Explain why the condition that the sequence  decreases to a limit of 0 is included in the Alternating Series Test.          and converge to 0.    Notice that and compare to the Harmonic series.    It is possible for a series to alternate, have the terms go to zero, have the terms not decrease to zero, and the series diverge.         Since both sequences and converge to 0 as goes to infinity, we see that the sequence of th terms of our series converge to 0 as goes to infinity.    Notice that . So our series can be rewritten as .  Since , the Limit Comparison Test shows that the series behaves like the harmonic series . Since the harmonic series diverges, it follows that the series diverges as well.    We have just demonstrated an example where the series alternates, the terms go to zero, but the terms don't decrease to zero, and the series diverges. This shows that the condition that the series decreases is necessary in the AST.       Conditionally convergent series exhibit interesting and unexpected behavior. In this exercise we examine the conditionally convergent alternating harmonic series and discover that addition is not commutative for conditionally convergent series. We will also encounter Riemann's Theorem concerning rearrangements of conditionally convergent series. Before we begin, we remind ourselves that , a fact which will be verified in a later section.     First we make a quick analysis of the positive and negative terms of the alternating harmonic series.     Show that the series diverges.    Show that the series diverges.    Based on the results of the previous parts of this exercise, what can we say about the sums and for any positive integer ? Be specific in your explanation.       Recall addition of real numbers is commutative; that is for any real numbers and . This property is valid for any sum of finitely many terms, but does this property extend when we add infinitely many terms together?  The answer is no, and something even more odd happens. Riemann's Theorem (after the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann) states that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any prescribed sum. More specifically, this means that if we choose any real number , we can rearrange the terms of the alternating harmonic series so that the sum is . To understand how Riemann's Theorem works, let's assume for the moment that the number we want our rearrangement to converge to is positive. Our job is to find a way to order the sum of terms of the alternating harmonic series to converge to .     Explain how we know that, regardless of the value of , we can find a partial sum  of the positive terms of the alternating harmonic series that equals or exceeds . Let .    Explain how we know that, regardless of the value of , we can find a partial sum  so that .

Explain how we know that, regardless of the value of , we can find a partial sum of the remaining negative terms of the alternating harmonic series so that .    Explain why we can continue this process indefinitely and find a sequence whose terms are partial sums of a rearrangement of the terms in the alternating harmonic series so that .          "

How do we determine the accuracy when we use a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function?      So far, each infinite series we have discussed has been a series of real numbers, such as .  In the remainder of this chapter, we will include series that involve a variable. For instance, if in the geometric series in Equation we replace the ratio with the variable , we have the infinite (still geometric) series .  Here we see something very interesting: because a geometric series converges whenever its ratio satisfies , and the sum of a convergent geometric series is , we can say that for , .   Equation states that the non-polynomial function on the right is equal to the infinite polynomial expresssion on the left. Because the terms on the left get very small as gets large, we can truncate the series and say, for example, that for small values of . This shows one way that a polynomial function can be used to approximate a non-polynomial function; such approximations are one of the main themes in this section and the next.  In Preview Activity , we begin our exploration of approximating functions with polynomials.     Preview Activity showed how we can approximate the number using linear, quadratic, and other polynomial functions; we then used similar ideas in Preview Activity to approximate . In this activity, we review and extend the process to find the best quadratic approximation to the exponential function around the origin. Let throughout this activity.     Find a formula for , the linearization of at . (We label this linearization because it is a first degree polynomial approximation.) Recall that is a good approximation to for values of close to . Plot and near to illustrate this fact.    Since is not linear, the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one. To obtain better approximations, we want to develop a different approximation that bends to make it more closely fit the graph of near . To do so, we add a quadratic term to . In other words, we let for some real number . We need to determine the value of that makes the graph of best fit the graph of near .  Remember that was a good linear approximation to near ; this is because and . It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of so that . Remember, we are letting .     Calculate to show that .    Calculate to show that .    Calculate . Then find a value for so that .    Explain why the condition will put an appropriate bend in the graph of to make fit the graph of around .

This is why is a good approximation to for values of close to .       Since we have that as desired.    A simple calculation shows . So as desired.    A simple calculation shows . So . To have we must have or .    The second derivative of a function tells us the concavity of the function. Concavity measures how the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of the function are changing. This tells us how much bend there is in the graph. So if , then will have the same bend in it at as does. This will make the graph of mold to the graph of around .            Taylor Polynomials  Taylor polynomials   Preview Activity illustrates the first steps in the process of approximating functions with polynomials. Using this process we can approximate trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and other nonpolynomial functions as closely as we like (for certain values of ) with polynomials. This is extraordinarily useful in that it allows us to calculate values of these functions to whatever precision we like using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which can be easily programmed in a computer.  We next extend the approach in Preview Activity to arbitrary functions at arbitrary points. Let be a function that has as many derivatives as we need at a point . Recall that is the tangent line to at and is given by the formula . is the linear approximation to near that has the same slope and function value as at the point .  We next want to find a quadratic approximation so that more closely models near . Consider the following calculations of the values and derivatives of :   .  To make fit better than , we want and to have the same concavity at , in addition to having the same slope and function value. That is, we want to have .  This implies that and thus .  Therefore, the quadratic approximation to centered at is .  This approach extends naturally to polynomials of higher degree. We define polynomials , and in general .  The defining property of these polynomials is that for each , and all its first derivatives must agree with those of at . In other words we require that for all from 0 to .  To see the conditions under which this happens, suppose .  Then and, in general, .  So having means that and therefore for each value of .

It is possible that an th order Taylor polynomial is not a polynomial of degree ; that is, the order of the approximation can be different from the degree of the polynomial. For example, in Activity we found that the second order Taylor polynomial centered at for is . In this case, the second order Taylor polynomial is a degree 1 polynomial.    Taylor Series  Taylor series  In Activity we saw that the fourth order Taylor polynomial for centered at is .  The pattern we found for the derivatives describe the higher-order Taylor polynomials, e.g., , and so on. It is instructive to consider the graphical behavior of these functions; Figure shows the graphs of a few of the Taylor polynomials centered at for the sine function.   The order 1, 5, 7, and 9 Taylor polynomials centered at for .             Notice that is close to the sine function only for values of that are close to , but as we increase the degree of the Taylor polynomial the Taylor polynomials provide a better fit to the graph of the sine function over larger intervals. This illustrates the general behavior of Taylor polynomials: for any sufficiently well-behaved function, the sequence of Taylor polynomials converges to the function on larger and larger intervals (though those intervals may not necessarily increase without bound). If the Taylor polynomials ultimately converge to on its entire domain, we write .   Taylor series   Let be a function all of whose derivatives exist at .

The Interval of Convergence of a Taylor Series  Taylor series interval of convergence  interval of convergence  In the previous section (in Figure and Activity ) we observed that the Taylor polynomials centered at for , , and converged to these functions for all values of in their domain, but that the Taylor polynomials centered at for converge to on the interval and diverge for all other values of . So the Taylor series for a function does not need to converge for all values of in the domain of .  Our observations suggest two natural questions: can we determine the values of for which a given Taylor series converges? And does the Taylor series for a function actually converge to ?    Graphical evidence suggests that the Taylor series centered at for converges for all values of . To verify this, use the Ratio Test to determine all values of for which the Taylor series converges absolutely.    Recall that the Ratio Test applies only to series of nonnegative terms. In this example, the variable may have negative values. But we are interested in absolute convergence, so we apply the Ratio Test to the series .  Now, observe that for any value of . So the Taylor series converges absolutely for every value of , and thus converges for every value of .    One question still remains: while the Taylor series for converges for all , what we have done does not tell us that this Taylor series actually converges to for each . We'll return to this question when we consider the error in a Taylor approximation near the end of this section.  We can apply the main idea from Example in general. To determine the values of for which a Taylor series , centered at will converge, we apply the Ratio Test with . The series converges if .  Observe that , so when we apply the Ratio Test, we get .  Note suppose that ,  so that .  There are three possibilities for : can be , it can be a finite positive value, or it can be infinite. Based on this value of , we can determine for which values of the original Taylor series converges.     If , then the Taylor series converges on .    If is infinite, then the Taylor series converges only at .    If is finite and nonzero, then the Taylor series converges absolutely for all that satisfy or for all such that , which is the interval . Because the Ratio Test is inconclusive when the , the endpoints have to be checked separately.     It is important to notice that the set of values at which a Taylor series converges is always an interval centered at . For this reason, the set on which a Taylor series converges is called the interval of convergence . Half the length of the interval of convergence is called the radius of convergence . Taylor series radius of convergence If the interval of convergence of a Taylor series is infinite, then we say that the radius of convergence is infinite.

So the interval of convergence of the Taylor series for centered at is .       The Ratio Test allows us to determine the set of values for which a Taylor series converges absolutely. However, just because a Taylor series for a function converges, we cannot be certain that the Taylor series actually converges to . To show why and where a Taylor series does in fact converge to the function , we next consider the error that is present in Taylor polynomials.    Error Approximations for Taylor Polynomials  Taylor polynomial error  We now know how to find Taylor polynomials for functions such as , and how to determine the interval of convergence of the corresponding Taylor series. We next develop an error bound that will tell us how well an th order Taylor polynomial approximates its generating function . This error bound will also allow us to determine whether a Taylor series on its interval of convergence actually equals the function from which the Taylor series is derived. Finally, we will be able to use the error bound to determine the order of the Taylor polynomial that we will ensure that approximates to the desired degree of accuracy.  For this argument, we assume throughout that we center our approximations at (but a similar argument holds for approximations centered at ). We define the exact error, , that results from approximating with by .  We are particularly interested in , the distance between and . Because for , we know that for . Furthermore, since is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to , we know that .  Thus, since , it follows that for all .  Suppose that we want to approximate at a number close to using . If we assume is bounded by some number on , so that for all , then we can say that for all between and . Equivalently, on . Next, we integrate the three terms in Inequality from to , and thus find that for every value of in . Since , the First FTC tells us that for every in .  Integrating this last inequality, we obtain and thus for all in .  Integrating times, we arrive at for all in . This enables us to conclude that for all in , and we have found a bound on the approximation's error, .  Our work above was based on the approximation centered at ; the argument may be generalized to hold for any value of , which results in the following theorem.   The Lagrange Error Bound for  Lagrange error bound  Let be a continuous function with continuous derivatives. Suppose that is a positive real number such that on the interval . If is the th order Taylor polynomial for centered at , then .   We can use this error bound to tell us important information about Taylor polynomials and Taylor series, as we see in the following examples and activities.    Determine how well the 10th order Taylor polynomial for , centered at , approximates .    To answer this question we use , , , and in the Lagrange error bound formula. We also need to find an appropriate value for . Note that the derivatives of are all equal to or . Thus, for any and . Therefore, we can choose to be . Then .  So approximates to within at most . A computer algebra system tells us that with an actual difference of about .      Let be the th order Taylor polynomial for centered at . Determine how large we need to choose so that approximates to decimal places.    Small hints for each of the prompts above.     .    In this example, if we can find a value of so that then we will have .  Again we use , , , and from the previous example. So we need to find to make .  There is no good way to solve equations involving factorials, so we simply use trial and error, evaluating at different values of until we get one we need.                              So we need to use an of at least 27 to ensure accuracy to 20 decimal places.  A computer algebra system gives and we can see that these agree to 20 places.      Show that the Taylor series for actually converges to for all .    Recall from the previous example that since , we know for any and . This allows us to choose in the Lagrange error bound formula. Thus, for every .  We showed in earlier work that the Taylor series converges for every value of . Because the terms of any convergent series must approach zero, it follows that for every value of . Thus, taking the limit as in the inequality , it follows that .  As a result, we can now write for every real number .         Show that the Taylor series centered at for converges to for every real number .    Next we consider the Taylor series for .

Combine the results of (a) and (b)        .          Compare Example .       Let . Since , for every natural number . Since is an increasing function, we know that on the interval for any fixed positive value of . Thus, by the Lagrange error formula, we can say that . Since the series converges for every , as , and thus as for every in . Further, since is a constant independent of , as well. Thus, , as desired.    When , we know . Thus, we can repeat our argument in (a) but replace with , and everything else holds in the same way.    Because we have shown that the Taylor series for converges to for both every nonnegative -value and for every negative -value, it follows that we have convergence for every value of .       Since is increasing on we know that on . Now , so . We want a value of that makes this error term less than . Testing various values of gives so we can choose . A computer algebra system shows that while and we can see that these two approximations agree to 8 decimal places.         Summary     We can use Taylor polynomials to approximate functions. This allows us to approximate values of functions using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of real numbers. The th order Taylor polynomial centered at of a function is .    The Taylor series centered at for a function is . The th order Taylor polynomial centered at for is the th partial sum of its Taylor series centered at .

In addition, Thus, the 3rd order Taylor polynomial centered at is . Note that this is the same polynomial as , which is not surprising since the degree 3 Taylor polynomial is the degree 3 polynomial that has the same value, slope, concavity, and third derivative at as the original.    Since for all , , and similarly every higher derivative of will be zero. Thus, the the 4th, 12th, and 100th order Taylor polynomials (centered at ) are all identical to found in (a). for . We should expect this because all of the higher derivatives (than the third) of the original function are identically zero.    For , the degree Taylor polyomial of will be given by the usual formula. But for every , . That is, all of the Taylor polynomials of degree at least that of the original function are simply the function itself.       The examples we have considered in this section have all been for Taylor polynomials and series centered at 0, but Taylor polynomials and series can be centered at any value of . We look at examples of such Taylor polynomials in this exercise.     Let . Find the Taylor polynomials up through order four of centered at . Then find the Taylor series for centered at .

It follows that the first four Taylor polynomials of are From the pattern, the Taylor series for centered at is which is expected because of the repeating patterns in the derivatives of the sine function evaluated at .    For , , , , and . It follows that , , , , and . Thus, the fourth Taylor polynomial (in which we can see the polynomials of lower degree) is . Simplifying the coefficients and seeing the pattern, it follows that the Taylor series for centered at is     To estimate to two decimal places, we use the fact that for near , and thus . Because is an alternating series, we need to know when the next term in the series is less than , which occurs when . Thus, if we compute , we get the desired estimate. We note particularly that , which is indeed an estimate of accurate to two decimal places.

We have noted in our work with Taylor polynomials and Taylor series that polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics, in part because they require only addition and multiplication to evaluate. From the point of view of calculus, polynomials are especially nice: we can easily differentiate or integrate any polynomial. In light of our work in Section , we now know that several important non-polynomials have polynomial-like expansions. For example, for any real number , .  There are two settings where other series like the one for arise: we may be given an expression such as and we seek the values of for which the expression makes sense. Or we may be trying to find an unknown function that has expression , and we try to determine the values of the constants , , . The latter situation is explored in Preview Activity .    In Chapter , we learned some of the many important applications of differential equations, and learned some approaches to solve or analyze them. Here, we consider an important approach that will allow us to solve a wider variety of differential equations.  Let's consider the familiar differential equation from exponential population growth given by , where is the constant of proportionality. While we can solve this differential equation using methods we have already learned, we take a different approach now that can be applied to a much larger set of differential equations. For the rest of this activity, let's assume that . We will use our knowledge of Taylor series to find a solution to the differential equation .  To do so, we assume that we have a solution and that has a Taylor series that can be written in the form , where the coefficients are undetermined. Our task is to find the coefficients.     Assume that we can differentiate a power series term by term. By taking the derivative of with respect to and substituting the result into the differential equation , show that the equation must be satisfied in order for to be a solution of the DE.    Two series are equal if and only if they have the same coefficients on like power terms. Use this fact to find a relationship between and .    Now write in terms of . Then write in terms of .    Write in terms of . Then write in terms of .    Write in terms of . Then write in terms of .    Observe that there is a pattern in (b)-(e). Find a general formula for in terms of .    Write the series expansion for using only the unknown coefficient . From this, determine what familiar functions satisfy the differential equation . ( Hint : Compare to a familiar Taylor series.)          Differentiation term by term gives .  We then substitute this series into the differential equation to obtain the equation     When we write the first few terms of the series on either side of our differential equation we obtain .  Equating the constant terms gives us .    Equating the degree 1 terms gives us or . Since , we have .    Equating the degree 2 terms gives us or . Since , we have .    Equating the degree 3 terms gives us or . Since , we have .    Equating the degree terms gives us or . It appears that , so we have .    Since we have .  So the functions that satisfy the differential equation are the exponential functions of the form .         Power Series  power series  As Preview Activity shows, it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series, and then determine the coefficients from other information. In other words, we define a function as an infinite series of powers of and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function. This method allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations, even if we cannot solve them explicitly. This is different from our work with Taylor series since we are not using an original function to generate the coefficients of the series.   power series definition   A power series centered at is a function of the form where is a sequence of real numbers and is an independent variable.    A power series defines a function whose domain is the set of values for which the power series converges. We therefore write .  It turns out that See Exercise in this section. , on its interval of convergence, every power series is in fact the Taylor series of the function it defines, so all of the techniques we developed in the previous section can be applied to power series as well.    Consider the power series defined by .  What are and ? Find a general formula for and determine the values for which this power series converges.    If we evaluate at we obtain the series which is a geometric series with ratio . So we can sum this series and find that .  Similarly, .  In general, is a geometric series with ratio , so provided that (which ensures that the ratio is less than 1 in absolute value). Thus, the power series that defines converges for .    As we did for Taylor series, we define the interval of convergence of a power series to be the set of values of for which the series converges. And as we did with Taylor series, we typically use the Ratio Test to find the values of for which the power series converges absolutely, and then check the endpoints separately if the radius of convergence is finite.    Let . Determine the interval of convergence of this power series.    First we will plot some of the partial sums of this power series to get an idea of the interval of convergence. Let for each . Figure shows plots of (in red), (in blue), and (in green).   Graphs of some partial sums of the power series .    The behavior of in particular suggests that appears to be converging to a particular curve on the interval , while growing without bound outside of that interval. Thus, the interval of convergence might be . To verify our conjecture, we apply the Ratio Test. Now, , so .  Therefore, the Ratio Test tells us that converges absolutely when and diverges when . Because the Ratio Test is inconclusive when , we need to check and individually.  When , observe that .  This is a -series with , which we know converges. When , we have .  This is an alternating series, and since the sequence decreases to 0, the power series converges by the Alternating Series Test. Thus, the interval of convergence of this power series is .      Determine the interval of convergence of each power series.                                    Small hints for each of the prompts above.           .     .     .     .     .          We use the Ratio Test with : . So the power series converges absolutely when or when and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.     When our power series is which is just a scalar multiple of the alternating harmonic series and so converges.    When our power series is which is just a scalar multiple of the harmonic series and so diverges.     Therefore, the interval of convergence of the power series is .    We use the Ratio Test with : . So the power series converges absolutely when or when and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.     When our power series is . Since as , this series diverges by the Divergence Test.    When our power series is which again diverges by the Divergence Test.     Therefore, the interval of convergence of the power series is .    We use the Ratio Test with : . So the power series converges absolutely when or when and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.     When our power series is . Since as , this series diverges by the Divergence Test.    When our power series is , which again diverges by the Divergence Test.     Therefore, the interval of convergence of the power series is .    We use the Ratio Test with : . So the power series converges absolutely on the interval .    We use the Ratio Test with : unless . So the interval of convergence of the power series is .         Manipulating Power Series  We know power series expansions for important functions such as and . Often, we can use a known power series expansion to find a power series for a different, but related, function. The next activity demonstrates one way to do this.    Our goal in this activity is to find a power series expansion for centered at .  While we could use the methods of Section and differentiate several times to look for patterns and find the Taylor series for , we seek an alternate approach because of how complicated the derivatives of quickly become.     What is the Taylor series expansion for ? What is the interval of convergence of this series?    How is related to ? Explain, and hence substitute for in the power series expansion for . Given the relationship between and , how is the resulting series related to ?    For which values of will this power series expansion for be valid? Why?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           for .     .     .          Recall that for .    Substituting for in the power series expansion for gives .    This power series expansion for will be valid as long as or for .       In a previous section we found several important Maclaurin series and their intervals of convergence. Here, we list these key functions and their corresponding expansions.       As we saw in Activity , we can use these known series to find other power series expansions for related functions such as , , and .    Let be the function given by the power series expansion .     Assume that we can differentiate a power series term by term, just like we can differentiate a (finite) polynomial. Use the fact that to find a power series expansion for .    Observe that and have familiar Taylor series. What familiar functions are these? What known relationship does our work demonstrate?    What is the series expansion for ? What familiar function is ?          Small hints for each of the prompts above.           .     .     .          Note that .    We recognize as and as . This gives the known differentiation formula .    We see that , which is the series expansion for as expected       Our work in Activity holds more generally. The corresponding theorem, which we will not prove, states that we can differentiate a power series for a function term by term and obtain the series expansion for , and similarly we can integrate a series expansion for a function term by term and obtain the series expansion for . For both, the radius of convergence of the resulting series is the same as the original, though it is possible that the convergence status of the various series may differ at the endpoints. The formal statement of the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem follows.   Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem  power series differentiation and integration theorem  Suppose has a power series expansion and that the series converges absolutely to on the interval . Then, the power series obtained by differentiating the power series for term by term converges absolutely to on the interval . That is, .   Similarly, the power series obtained by integrating the power series for term by term converges absolutely on the interval , and .  This theorem validates the steps we took in Activity . It tells us that we can differentiate and integrate term by term on the interior of the interval of convergence, but it does not tell us what happens at the endpoints of this interval. We always need to check what happens at the endpoints separately. More importantly, we can use use the approach of differentiating or integrating a series term by term to find new series.    Find a series expansion centered at for , as well as its interval of convergence.    While we could differentiate repeatedly and look for patterns in the derivative values at in an attempt to find the Maclaurin series for from the definition, it turns out to be far easier to use a known series in an insightful way. In Activity , we found that for . Recall that , and therefore .  It follows that we can integrate the series for term by term to obtain the power series expansion for . Doing so, we find that .  The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that this equality is valid for at least .  To find the value of the constant , we can use the fact that . So , and we must have . Therefore, for at least .  It is a straightforward exercise to check that the power series converges both when and when ; in each case, we have an alternating series with terms that decrease to , and thus the interval of convergence for the series expansion for in Equation is .      Find a power series expansion for centered at and determine its interval of convergence.    Use the Taylor series expansion for centered at .     . for .    Using the Taylor series for we have that .  Integrating the left and right sides of this last equation gives us for . Since we have that and so . We conclude that . for .      Summary     A power series is a series of the form .    We can often assume a solution to a given problem can be written as a power series, then use the information in the problem to determine the coefficients in the power series. This method allows us to approximate solutions to certain problems using partial sums of the power series; that is, we can find approximate solutions that are polynomials.    The connection between power series and Taylor series is that they are essentially the same thing: on its interval of convergence a power series is the Taylor series of its sum.             Finding coefficients in a power series expansion of a rational function   Represent the function as a power series            Find the radius of convergence  .                                 . Then we can see that , making , , , etc. Regarding the radius of convergence, we perform the standard ratio test: And then , making .      Finding coefficients in a power series expansion of a function involving   The function is represented as a power series   Find the first few coefficients in the power series.            Find the radius of convergence of the series.                                   , e.g. . ; ; . ;   ; ; and so on. Another way is to use the power series for arctan: . Then  . So , , , , ... This is an alternating series. It converges if and only if . This limit is equal to 0 if and only if , so . Therefore the radius of convergence is .       We can use power series to approximate definite integrals to which known techniques of integration do not apply. We will illustrate this in this exercise with the definite integral .   Use the Taylor series for to find the Taylor series for . What is the interval of convergence for the Taylor series for ? Explain.    Integrate the Taylor series for term by term to obtain a power series expansion for .    Use the result from part (b) to explain how to evaluate . Determine the number of terms you will need to approximate to 3 decimal places.          , with interval of convergence .     .     . Use to generate the desired estimate.         The Taylor series expansion for centered at is . Substituting for gives us , as the Taylor series for centered at . Since the interval of convergence for the Taylor series for is , it follows that the interval of convergence of the Taylor series for is also .    We can integrate a Taylor series term by term on its interval of convergence, so .    To evaluate , we evaluate the antiderivative at and and subtract. So . The resulting series is an alternating series, so we can find a value of that makes the th partial sum of the series approximate the sum of the series to decimal places by determining a value of such that . This is not an inequality that we can solve algebraically, so we use trial and error. Doing so shows that will work.       There is an important connection between power series and Taylor series. Suppose is defined by a power series centered at 0 so that .     Determine the first 4 derivatives of evaluated at 0 in terms of the coefficients .    Show that for each positive integer .    Explain how the result of (b) tells us the following:   On its interval of convergence, a power series is the Taylor series of its sum.           Then   So and for each . But these are just the coefficients of the Taylor series expansion of , which leads us to the following observation.         Observe that and therefore .    Since every term of this series vanishes at except the first. Thus it follows , so .    Since for each , we see that these are just the coefficients of the Taylor series expansion of , and thus we get the unsurprising result that the coefficients of a power series are identical to the Taylor series of the power series.       In this exercise we will begin with a strange power series and then find its sum. The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence whose first few terms are , where each term in the sequence after the first two is the sum of the preceding two terms. That is, , and for we have .  Now consider the power series .  We will determine the sum of this power series in this exercise.     Explain why each of the following is true.                  Show that .    Now use the equation to find a simple form for that doesn't involve a sum.    Use a computer algebra system or some other method to calculate the first 8 derivatives of evaluated at 0. Why shouldn't the results surprise you?       Airy's equation The general differential equations of the form is called Airy's equation. These equations arise in many problems, such as the study of diffraction of light, diffraction of radio waves around an object, aerodynamics, and the buckling of a uniform column under its own weight. , can be used to model an undamped vibrating spring with spring constant (note that is an unknown function of ). So the solution to this differential equation will tell us the behavior of a spring-mass system as the spring ages (like an automobile shock absorber). Assume that a solution has a Taylor series that can be written in the form , where the coefficients are undetermined. Our job is to find the coefficients.    Differentiate the series for term by term to find the series for . Then repeat to find the series for .    Substitute your results from part (a) into the Airy equation and show that we can write Equation in the form .    At this point, it would be convenient if we could combine the series on the left in , but one written with terms of the form and the other with terms in the form . Explain why .    Now show that .    We can now substitute and into to obtain .  Combine the like powers of in the two series to show that our solution must satisfy .    Use equation to show the following:      for every positive integer ,     ,     .       Use the previous part to conclude that the general solution to the Airy equation is .  Any values for and then determine a specific solution that we can approximate as closely as we like using this series solution.     The results from the various part of this exercise show that .       .    We substitute our series from (a) into the Airy equation to obtain the equation .  Distributing the in the second term on the left yields the desired equation.    Note that .  In other words, we can re-index this series by increasing every by 2, or replacing with , with and with . This gives us the next desired equation.    As we did in the previous part, .    Notice that we have like powers of in the two series, so we can combine them and obtain .    Equation implies that and for all .  Solving for in the second equation shows that .  These last equations are called recurrence relations and allow us to write every coefficient of in terms of and . For example, shows that . We can continue in this way to obtain the first 10 coefficients in terms of and : .  It may not be obvious, but there is a pattern.   All of the terms involving are 0. These terms are , , , etc. The subscripts of these terms are all of the form . So for every positive integer .    The terms that involve have the form , , , etc. and are all of the form for positive integers . The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for is . So .
