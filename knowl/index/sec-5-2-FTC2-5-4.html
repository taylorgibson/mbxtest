<div class="para">so we know a formula for the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> and we know that <span class="process-math">\(E(0) = 0\text{.}\)</span> This information is precisely the type we were given in <a href="sec-3-1-tests.html#pte" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/act-3-1-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Activity 3.1.2">Activity 3.1.2</a>, where we were given information about the derivative of a function, but lacked a formula for the function itself.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Using the first and second derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> along with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(E(0) = 0\text{,}\)</span> we can determine more information about the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span> First, we note that for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x^2} \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(E'(x) \gt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is an always increasing function. Further, as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(E'(x) = e^{-x^2} \to 0\text{,}\)</span> so the slope of the function <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> tends to zero as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \infty\)</span> (and similarly as <span class="process-math">\(x \to -\infty\)</span>). Indeed, it turns out that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has horizontal asymptotes as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases or decreases without bound.</div> <div class="para">In addition, we can observe that <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}\text{,}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(E''(0) = 0\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) \lt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) \gt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> This information tells us that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is concave up for <span class="process-math">\(x\lt 0\)</span> and concave down for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\)</span> with a point of inflection at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The only thing we lack at this point is a sense of how big <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> can get as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases. If we use a midpoint Riemann sum with 10 subintervals to estimate <span class="process-math">\(E(2)\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(E(2) \approx 0.8822\text{;}\)</span> a similar calculation to estimate <span class="process-math">\(E(3)\)</span> shows little change (<span class="process-math">\(E(3) \approx 0.8862\)</span>), so it appears that as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases without bound, <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> approaches a value just larger than <span class="process-math">\(0.886\text{,}\)</span> which aligns with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has horizontal asymptotes. Putting all of this information together (and using the symmetry of <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\)</span>), we see the results shown in <a href="sec-5-2-FTC2.html#SEL" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/F-5-2-erf.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 5.2.4">Figure 5.2.4</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/5_2_erf.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
