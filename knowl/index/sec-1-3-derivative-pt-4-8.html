For each such line, the slope of the secant line is <span class="process-math">\(m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\text{,}\)</span> where the value of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0\text{,}\)</span> the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\text{.}\)</span> If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the <em class="emphasis">tangent line</em> to the curve. This tangent line  (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\)</span> at the point <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> has slope <span class="process-math">\(m = f'(a)\text{.}\)</span>
