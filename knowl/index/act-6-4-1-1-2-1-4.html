<div class="para">From physics, <em class="emphasis">Hookeâ€™s Law</em>  for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length. That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units from its natural length is <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = kx\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> (which is called the <em class="emphasis">spring constant</em>.) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet. Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.</div>
