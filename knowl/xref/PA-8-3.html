<div class="para">Have you ever wondered how your calculator can produce a numeric approximation for complicated numbers like <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\text{?}\)</span> After all, the only operations a calculator can really perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the operations that make up polynomials. This activity provides the first steps in understanding how this process works. Throughout the activity, let <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha" id="vjh">
<li><div class="para">Find the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and use this linearization to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> That is, find a formula <span class="process-math">\(L(x)\)</span> for the tangent line, and compute <span class="process-math">\(L(1)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(L(1) \approx f(1) = e\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">The linearization of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> does not provide a good approximation to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to 0. With the linearization, we had both <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> share the same value as the linearization at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> We will now use a quadratic approximation <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> centered at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> which has the property that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-roman" id="Iht">
<li><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Then, use <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> by observing that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We can continue approximating <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> with polynomials of larger degree whose higher derivatives agree with those of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> better for more values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> around 0. For example, let <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_3(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Use <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in a way similar to how you did so with <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> above.</div></li>
