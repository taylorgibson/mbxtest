<div class="para">For quantities of equal weight, such as two children on a teeter-totter, the balancing point is found by taking the average of their locations. When the weights of the quantities differ, we use a weighted average of their respective locations to find the balancing point.</div>

<li><div class="para">Suppose that a shelf is 6 feet long, with its left end situated at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span> If one book of weight 1 lb is placed at <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = 0\text{,}\)</span> and another book of weight 1 lb is placed at <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 6\text{,}\)</span> what is the location of <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\text{,}\)</span> the point at which the shelf would (theoretically) balance on a fulcrum?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now, say that we place four books on the shelf, each weighing 1 lb: at <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = 0\text{,}\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 2\text{,}\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x_3 = 4\text{,}\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x_4 = 6\text{.}\)</span> Find <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\text{,}\)</span> the balancing point of the shelf.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How does <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\)</span> change if we change the location of the third book?

<li><div class="para">Next, suppose that we place four books on the shelf, but of varying weights: at <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = 0\)</span> a 2-lb book, at <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 2\)</span> a 3-lb book, at <span class="process-math">\(x_3 = 4\)</span> a 1-lb book, and at <span class="process-math">\(x_4 = 6\)</span> a 1-lb book.

<li><div class="para">What happens if we change the location of one of the books? Say that we keep everything the same in (d), except that <span class="process-math">\(x_3 = 5\text{.}\)</span> How does <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\)</span> change?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What happens if we change the weight of one of the books? Say that we keep everything the same in (d), except that the book at <span class="process-math">\(x_3 = 4\)</span> now weighs 2 lbs. How does <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\)</span> change?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Experiment with a couple of different scenarios of your choosing where you move one of the books to the left, or you decrease the weight of one of the books.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Write a couple of sentences to explain how adjusting the location of one of the books or the weight of one of the books affects the location of the balancing point of the shelf.
