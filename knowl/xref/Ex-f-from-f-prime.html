<div class="para">Since we already have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> written in factored form, it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is defined for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we need only determine where <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> From the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">and the zero product property, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(x = 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\)</span> are critical numbers of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> (There is no value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that makes <span class="process-math">\(e^{-2x} = 0\text{.}\)</span>)</div>
</div> <div class="para">Next, to apply the first derivative test, we’d like to know the sign of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> must be the same for every <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\text{.}\)</span> We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> on the relevant intervals, along with the corresponding behavior of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>

For instance, for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\text{,}\)</span> we could determine the sign of <span class="process-math">\(e^{-2x}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((3-x)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^2\)</span> at the value <span class="process-math">\(x = -2\text{.}\)</span> We note that both <span class="process-math">\(e^{-2x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^2\)</span> are positive regardless of the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\((3-x)\)</span> is also positive at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2\text{.}\)</span> Hence, each of the three terms in <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive, which we indicate by writing “<span class="process-math">\(+++\text{.}\)</span>” Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> which we denote by the “<span class="process-math">\(+\)</span>” in the interval to the left of <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{.}\)</span> And, since <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive on that interval, we know that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing, so we write “INC” to represent the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In a similar way, we find that <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing on <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is negative and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 3\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Now we look for critical numbers at which <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> changes sign. In this example, <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> changes sign only at <span class="process-math">\(x = 3\text{,}\)</span> from positive to negative, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a relative maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = 3\text{.}\)</span> Although <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a critical number at <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing both before and after <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{.}\)</span>
